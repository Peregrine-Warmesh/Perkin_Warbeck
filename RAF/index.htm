<H2>The poetry of RAF Gordon

<H3>Humans</H3>
<P>Humans are a strange people, private and absurd<BR>
they stalk about inflamed by curiosity<BR>
devious they wander<BR>
perpetrators of mysterious notions<BR>
they fumble into slippers<BR>
painstakingly they boil up cocoa for reasons of its taste<BR>
their teeth enjoy toast for crunching brings such a nice feeling<BR>
they chant &quot;ho ho ho&quot; at funny jokes and like to know awkward things about
people in another land<BR>
little animals roam about in chains at their feet<BR>
they keep them fluffy and buy them bones because they think them stupid<BR>
and are proud that they are better creatures and much cleverer.<BR>

<H3>Animal Plot</H3>
<P>animals greet me as I pass<BR>
squeaks of quaint admiration<BR>
but darker creatures that love me not plot insidiously against my very blood<BR>
I amble by pretending not to sense their presence as they hop across walls
to hide their wicked plans<BR>
they contrive to terminate my life quite soon in most unpleasant fashion<BR>
but I warn them in tones profound and thunderous<BR>
be it evening frog or dawn light sparrow<BR>
I do not suffer torment from feathers or from farrow<BR>
the innocent squeak or hushed croak won't crush my living body<BR>
for I know fearsome friends most faithful<BR>
the fierce dog from the scrapyard's buckled twists<BR>
has shiny fangs that sip blood-reddily<BR>
and mangle sinews of slime-clad frog<BR>
the next door horse pulverises small birds neath the ruthless hooves of horn<BR>
and midnight spiders sing requiem mass to the fallen frogs<BR>
and rebellious sparrows who dare to cross my path  </P>

<H3>Modern Bicycles</H3>
<P>Prancing on hooves <BR>
obnoxious donkey<BR>
I'll sell you to the man<BR>
<I>No you won't</I> <BR>
<I>Yes I will</I><BR>
because &quot;for sale a bicycle&quot;<BR>
unfortunately with broken dynamo<BR>
oily chain, whirring sound <BR>
days to travel at a snail's pace through fresh faced countryside<BR>
I never liked you horse <BR>
stinking nosebag and clattering feet<BR>
these are modern times you know <BR>
and in future all men will have bicycles<BR>
bicycles with lights<BR>
shiny bicycles<BR>
fast bicycles<BR>
black bicycles<BR>
green bicycles<BR>
striped bicycles<BR>
huge bicycles<BR>
yes rich and poor, policeman and sailor<BR>
all will wear bicycle clips<BR>
obnoxious donkey go away<BR>
I don't need you any more<BR>
clippety clop clippety clop clippety clop<BR>
<H3>The Grand Tobacconer</H3>
Aha the Grand Tobaconner<BR>
'mongst sweet oaks and watermeadows does dwell<BR>
who speculates the ways of butterflies<BR>
but who wades in the bowels of hell<BR>
&quot;kind sir &quot;a gentleman once asked me<BR>
observing my ludicrous grin<BR>
&quot;what news of the Grand Tobacconner, his own dear kith and kin&quot; <BR>
there once was a sewage wastepipe <BR>
there once was a village green<BR>
there once was a Grand Tobacconer<BR>
had he lived he'd have married a queen<BR></BODY></HTML>
