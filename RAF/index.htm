<h3 style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><big>Humans</big></h3>
<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><big>Humans are a strange people, private and absurd<br>

they stalk about inflamed by curiosity<br>

devious they wander<br>

perpetrators of mysterious notions<br>

they fumble into slippers<br>

painstakingly they boil up cocoa for reasons of its taste<br>

their teeth enjoy toast for crunching brings such a nice feeling<br>

they chant "ho ho ho" at funny jokes and like to know awkward things about
people in another land<br>

little animals roam about in chains at their feet<br>

they keep them fluffy and buy them bones because they think them stupid<br>

and are proud that they are better creatures and much cleverer.<br>

</big></p>

<h3 style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><big>Animal Plot</big></h3>
<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><big>animals greet me as I pass<br>

squeaks of quaint admiration<br>

but darker creatures that love me not plot insidiously against my very blood<br>

I amble by pretending not to sense their presence as they hop across walls
to hide their wicked plans<br>

they contrive to terminate my life quite soon in most unpleasant fashion<br>

but I warn them in tones profound and thunderous<br>

be it evening frog or dawn light sparrow<br>

I do not suffer torment from feathers or from farrow<br>

the innocent squeak or hushed croak won't crush my living body<br>

for I know fearsome friends most faithful<br>

the fierce dog from the scrapyard's buckled twists<br>

has shiny fangs that sip blood-reddily<br>

and mangle sinews of slime-clad frog<br>

the next door horse pulverises small birds neath the ruthless hooves of horn<br>

and midnight spiders sing requiem mass to the fallen frogs<br>

and rebellious sparrows who dare to cross my path  </big></p>

<h3 style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><big>Modern Bicycles</big></h3>
<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><big>Prancing on hooves <br>

obnoxious donkey<br>

I'll sell you to the man<br>

<i>No you won't</i> <br>

<i>Yes I will</i><br>

because "for sale a bicycle"<br>

unfortunately with broken dynamo<br>

oily chain, whirring sound <br>

days to travel at a snail's pace through fresh faced countryside<br>

I never liked you horse <br>

stinking nosebag and clattering feet<br>

these are modern times you know <br>

and in future all men will have bicycles<br>

bicycles with lights<br>

shiny bicycles<br>

fast bicycles<br>

black bicycles<br>

green bicycles<br>

striped bicycles<br>

huge bicycles<br>

yes rich and poor, policeman and sailor<br>

all will wear bicycle clips<br>

obnoxious donkey go away<br>

I don't need you any more<br>

clippety clop clippety clop clippety clop<br>
