                Humans are a strange people, private and absurd<br>
                They stalk about inflamed by curiosity<br>
                Devious they wander<br>
                Perpetrators of mysterious notions<br>
                They fumble into slippers<br>
                Painstakingly they boil up cocoa for reasons of its taste<br>
                Their teeth enjoy toast for crunching brings such a nice feeling<br>
                They chant "ho ho ho" at funny jokes and like to know awkward things about people in another land<br>
                Little animals roam about in chains at their feet<br>
                They keep them fluffy and buy them bones because they think them stupid<br>
                And are proud that they are better creatures and much cleverer.

                Animals greet me as I pass<BR>
                Squeaks of quaint admiration<BR>
                But darker creatures that love me not plot insidiously against my very blood<BR>
                I amble by pretending not to sense their presence as they hop across walls to hide their wicked plans<BR>
                They contrive to terminate my life quite soon in most unpleasant fashion<BR>
                But I warn them in tones profound and thunderous<BR>
                Be it evening frog or dawn light sparrow<BR>
                I do not suffer torment from feathers or from farrow<BR>
                The innocent squeak or hushed croak won't crush my living body<BR>
                For I know fearsome friends most faithful<BR>
                The fierce dog from the scrapyard's buckled twists<BR>
                Has shiny fangs that sip blood-reddily<BR>
                And mangle sinews of slime-clad frog<BR>
                The next door horse pulverises small birds neath the ruthless hooves of horn<BR>
                And midnight spiders sing requiem mass to the fallen frogs<BR>
                And rebellious sparrows who dare to cross my path<BR>

Buzzing round his pipe<BR>
and rejoicing at his shriek<BR>

But again i died in agony<BR>
because of the boot and the<BR>
ground.<BR>
My soul explodes in jealously<BR>
Inanimacy (I’ve always held)<BR>
has no need in reincarnation<BR>
(Oh to be a slab)<BR>

But here am |<BR>
Black and gold -<BR>
Dying on a pavement<BR>
with the world spinning round me<BR>
this wasp in agony<BR>
Predestination is an enemy<BR>
its limits creativity<BR>
And now I am a horse<BR>
A nineteenth century horse.<BR>
