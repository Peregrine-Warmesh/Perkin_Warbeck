</B>What can I say ? He's at it again. I am no great fan of the Sons of
William or Mr Gascoigne, but that sending off was completely soft. A flapping
open palmed hand which skimmed Weighorst's nose, is probably the least
offensive thing Gazza has done in his tenure up here.<BR>

<P>Former Rangers star Trevor Steven, reflecting on the match in a TV studio,
offered words of comfort for Gascoigne.Steven said, &quot;I am very disappointed
for Paul and <B>I don't know what the referee was thinking about.</B> He
did not deserve to be red-carded.&quot;<BR>
One-time Celtic defender Paul Elliott, his fellow panellist, echoed that
view, commenting, &quot;It was a <B>bad decision and one consistent with
the referee's performance overall.<BR>
</B>&quot;Paul did raise his arm but it was only a sign of frustration
and there was <B>minimal contact </B>with Wieghorst.&quot;</P>

<P>Dundee United 1 Hibernian 1 (<A HREF="http://www.dcthomson.co.uk/courier/180897/sport2.htm">Dundee
Courier</A>)</P>

<P>Rowbotham, whose once promising refereeing career has never recovered
from the furore his handling of the <B>infamous </B>Rangers-Aberdeen at
Ibrox two seasons ago created, gave the veteran Tangerines defender his
marching orders after two bookings.</P>

<P>Malpas was sent packing after getting caught up in an <B>innocuous looking
</B>67th minute clash with Hibs' Jean-Marc Boco during which he appeared
to tred on the French left-back as he sought to retain his balance and
regain possession of a ball he had originally taken out of defence.</P>

<P>The contact seemed entirely accidental and the awarding of a free-kick
would have been sufficient sanction - but, to the <B>amazement </B>even
of some of Boco's team-mates, Rowbotham cautioned Malpas again.</P>

<P>However, he showed <B>remarkable leniency </B>in other instances, including
letting Lavety off with just a warning for shoving Pedersen after the pair
tangled on the touchline, completely ignoring an astonishing clash between
McGinlay and Dolan and failing to take action when Paul Tosh <B>planted
his studs </B>in Pedersen's thigh. </P>

<P>Until Maurice Malpas' <B>unwarranted dismissal </B>in the 67th minute,
United had fashioned a pleasing goal and then weathered the attacking thrusts
of the visitors in a manner which suggested that Hibs were on the verge
of becoming a spent force. </P>

<P>But then Malpas, who had earlier been booked for a trip on Pat McGinlay,
was shown a second yellow card after appearing to <B>stumble accidentally
</B>onto Frenchman Jean-Marc Boco. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rough justice for Malpas</FONT></B></P>

<P>That goal was largely down to the <B>curious influence </B>of the arbiter
of justice - the referee John Rowbotham. Over the piece perhaps the final
result was fair enough, but the manner of its achievement was strewn with
<B>inconsistencies and injustice</B>.</P>

<P>While other referees can choke matches with their use of yellow cards
John Rowbotham has an <B>unhappy reputation </B>for choking when he ought
to take action. Yesterday he booked three players and sent one off in dubious
circumstances and allowed many others to go un-punished. It was his sending
off of Maurice Malpas which left United feeling that they had suffered
most at his hands.</P>

<P>After 67 minutes Malpas, who had already been booked on the stroke of
half time, was tackled by Jean-Marc Boco. As he tried to get up he tangled
with the player and when play was stopped <B>the majority of the observers
thought a free kick would be awarded to the home side. </B>However, Mr
Rowbotham decided to show a second yellow card and for only the second
time in his career Malpas found himself ordered off.</P>

<P>...there can be little doubt that the manager agreed with the sentiments
of his players Andy Dow and Brian Grant, who both seemed to plead for the
referee to show clemency.</P>

<P>Nor did Mr Rowbotham need to dip into his pocket for a card. Had Malpas
stamped on his opponent then a red card should have been shown immediately.
The fact that it was not suggests that the foul was rather more <B>innocuous
and probably accidental</B>.</P>

<P>...but the most <B>dramatic improvement will be looked for from the
referee</B>.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Perkin Warbeck adds</FONT></B></P>

<P>Nearly all of the above concerns his decision to send off Maurice. The
incandescent ire which stimulated this page was more caused by his desire
to be the first referee in history to apply the rather strange new 5 second
rule. Even if one supports this rule, one would have thought that its first
introduction might have been subsequent not only to a warning but also
a more blatant example - Sieb was probably on one or two seconds over the
limit.</P>

<P>Fortunately none of the latter quality was required when the equaliser
finally arrived as a result once again of Mr Rowbotham's <B>renowned unpredictability</B>.
This time the official awarded Hearts a penalty for some unspecified infringement,
committed as Fulton's free-kick bobbled around harmlessly in the Motherwell
area.

<P>Robertson's slick turn was halted by the crudest of scything challenges
from Hunter, a tackle which Mr Rowbotham judged perfectly fair. Evidence
that the Kirkcaldy whistler had perhaps realised his <B>mistake </B>came
a couple of minutes later when Hughes was cautioned for a much less violent
attack on Paille midway inside the Hibs half. </P>

<P>Referee Rowbotham was struggling to put the lid back on the <B>can of
worms </B>he had helped to prise open and when he eventually did, it was
at the expense of any entertainment value left in what had become a poor
match.</P>

<P>Heart of Midlothian 2 Dunfermline Athletic 0 (<A HREF="http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/2-11-96.html">http://www.heartsfc.co.uk/2-11-96.html</A>)</P>

<P>Mr John Rowbotham of Kirkcaldy looked to have blown a promising career
as a Grade One referee with his<B> incompetent handling </B>of a stormy
encounter between Rangers and Aberdeen at Ibrox in the early part of last
season. After the initial outcry, the follicly-challenged whistler has
enjoyed something of a rehabilitation that reached a climax a few weeks
ago when he was awarded the corresponding fixture again. He seemed to survive
that test all right, but if his <B>completely inept display </B>at Tynecastle
on Saturday was anything to go by, it won't be long before he hits the
headlines again.</P>

<P>Mr Rowbotham contrived to book six players for a miscellany of trivial
non-offences, ignore any assistance offered by his often better-positioned
colleagues and leave fans and players alike breathing a huge sigh of relief
that his <B>unpredictability </B>hadn't resulted in dismissals for one
or more players. </P>
