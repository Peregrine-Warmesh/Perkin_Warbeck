<P>The night of 20th May 1987. We were one down from the first leg and the team
seemed drained by the season. The worst of the Scottish Cup final defeats (the
St Mirren one) had been on the Saturday. Gothenborg scored quite early and that
was that really. Clarkie salvaged some pride with an equaliser. But it was the
scenes that followed the game that mark this night down in the memory. It is
hard to describe them so I won't try.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
