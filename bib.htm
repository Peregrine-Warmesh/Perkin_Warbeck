<P>Abstract       One hundred and seventeen males over the age of 55 were
investigated for possible prostatic obstruction. About half of      the cases in
this series could have been objectively classified as unobstructed or obstructed
from the maximum flow rate      alone. In about two-thirds of the cases
obstruction could be satisfactorily assessed from the maximum flow rate together
     with the detrusor pressure at maximum flow. It was not helpful to combine
these 2 measurements into a single urethral      resistance factor. In the
remaining one-third of the cases, obstruction could be objectively assessed only
from a plot of      detrusor pressure against flow rate throughout micturition.
In many of these cases both the pressure and the flow rate      were low and the
main peculiarity was that the contractile power of the bladder was weak.
Residual urine is a sign of an      abnormality of bladder function rather than
the direct result of urethral obstruction. </P>
