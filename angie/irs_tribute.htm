<H1>Tribute by Lorna Kennedy to her father Dr Iain Small</H1>

<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Smalls, Harpers, Kennedys,
Campbells, Shields, family, friends, colleagues, fellow thespians,
the task has fallen to me today to attempt to share with you the life
of Dr Iain Robert Small. Discussing this fact with a friend this
week, she concluded that if I told all the stories, we’d be here
for a month. I think we can all agree we don’t have that long, so
I’ll try my best to be succinct – but then again, I am my
father’s daughter.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Iain
Robert Small was born in Irvine, Ayrshire on 11</font><sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">th</font></sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">
February, 1961 as the youngest of Ramsay and Aileen Small’s four
boys. His father, Ramsay, was a doctor who specialised in Public
Health, and soon after Dad was born the family returned to Dundee as
Ramsay had been appointed as the deputy medical officer of health for
Tayside. On moving to Dundee, the family took up lifelong residence
at 46 Monifieth Road. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Life
in Broughty Ferry was a happy one, but not without its trials for
Dad. Being the youngest of 4 siblings is not an easy role – a fact
our Alison would go in to discover for herself 30 years later. In
fact, in the list of stories I received from my uncle Douglas earlier
this week, he grouped them together under the sub-heading
‘tormenting’. A few small examples of this would be the time he
was locked in the boot of a mini (an old mini mind – where the boot
was roughly the size of a shoe box), the time his brother Kenneth
‘set’ a tray of fat drippings then cut it into squares and
convinced Dad it was toffee, and Mum says I’m not allowed to tell
the story about the bottle of lemonade…</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Nonetheless,
he and his 3 brothers Ronald, Douglas and Kenneth (fondly known as
Henry, Doug, Nyaff and Dad, Angie, – ask Doug!) also had a lot of
fun together. As children, Stewart, Claire, Alison and I would often
ask him to tell us about ‘when he was a little boy’. Our
favourite was the tale of the dodgy VHF radios that came from Uncle
John’s shop that actually broadcast locally over BBC 2, and on
which the boys were mocking the accent of a particularly posh
neighbour.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Dad
was educated first at The Eastern Primary School, followed by Grove
Academy, before obtaining his degree in medicine from the University
of Dundee. From the age of 3 it was clear that he was a clever boy.
One Saturday at about that age, my Granny took him on the bus into
the town to do some shopping and somehow mother and son found
themselves separated. After searching for Dad with no success, Granny
decided the best thing to do was take the bus home to Broughty Ferry
and phone my Papa. In the meantime, 3-year-old Iain went to a Police
Box and told a policeman where his father worked, and so by the time
Granny called Papa, Dad was already in his care.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">It
was in this house that Dad inherited his intelligence, his wisdom,
his (sometimes brutal) honesty, his kindness, his love of music and
the arts, and his faith. On moving to Broughty Ferry the family
became the corner stone of Broughty Ferry Baptist Church and all 4
boys could be seen traipsing along St Vincent Street every Sunday
morning, and evening, fully kilted, to attend the services there. He
attended Sunday School there, and Crusaders then Youth Fellowship. In
fact, it was at Crusaders that he picked up one of his signature
preaching styles – how to turn a normal, everyday story into a
message from scripture. In my house this was known as ‘the sneaky
path’. And it was owing to this involvement with the young
evangelical community in Dundee that Dad would embark on the other
most important relationship in his life.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">On
the 27</font><sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">th</font></sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">
of December 1979, at a Christmas party for the Baptist and Hillbank
Youth Fellowships, a young Iain met a young Christine Isobel Harper.
The rest, as they say, is history. They were married in 1981 at the
fresh young ages of 19 and 20, and Stewart followed soon after. As
Dad was still studying for his degree in medicine, the young family
stayed with my grandparents at 46 Monifieth Road until 1983, when Dad
became Dr Iain Small and they moved to Stracathro. 1984 brought with
it a move to Monifieth, a job in Kings Cross in Dundee as a junior
house officer, and a first daughter, me. Shortly after Claire was
born in 1988, Dad became a GP and in 1989 our family made what would
be the most significant move of our lives: to Peterhead.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Moving
from their home in Dundee was difficult for Mum and Dad at first.
They knew nobody, they had 3 very young children and their family all
lived 100 miles away. So they threw themselves into the community who
embraced us in return, and we met some of the most wonderful friends
anyone could ask for – our Peterhead family. Many of you will be
here today from those groups, and we’ve heard already about his
work and the health centre, the football club, and his involvement in
Rock Challenge and Panto.  But there was also the Baptist Church –
who can forget Tuesday evenings spent at Rocket Ship and Explorers –
presenting on Waves Radio and Peterhead Athletics Club. When Alison
was born in 1991, with now four children under 10, Dad decided he
needed an excuse to be out of the house for 40 hours a week; marathon
running was just that excuse.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">And
he was good at it! Dad and I pounded out three marathons together.
Obviously, this happened after his dislocated knee – there’s no
way I was ever achieving the sort of pace that saw him take 2</font><sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">nd</font></sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">
place at the Peterhead half in 1993 in 1hr 16mins and 29 seconds. He
missed out on 1</font><sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">st</font></sup><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">
place that day by 10 seconds, but he beat both John Robertson and
Sandy Hastie: something he never let them forget. He inspired so many
people to join him in the 26.2 miles round London over the years.
First Iain Harper, then me, Claire, Alison and Ben Harper. Even Mum
was convinced to take her turn in 2012, with Dad her chief
cheerleader. And Stewart… oh yeah, you haven’t done it Stewart,
have you… yet! Our days of pain and torture around London are
memories I’m sure none of us will never forget, with Dad supporting
us all the way. He dragged me round my first, and I dragged him round
his last.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Life
in family Small was a full of fun and laughter. Our door was always
open, and that led to a whole range of randoms spending as much time
in our house as Dad did – Andy McLean, Stacey Dunn, Amy-Jo McLean,
Rebekah Buchan. And many of them were also invited to share in one of
Dad’s favourite past-times – his holidays. There were caravan
trips to Forfar, York and France, Cruises round the Med, the Middle
East and the Caribbean, Cycling holidays, sailing holidays where we
met the Mikkelsens, New York, Washington, Mexico, Dominican Republic.
Family weekends away to Ballater, Huntly or Pitlochry were an annual
highlight for Dad when he and my Uncles dragged us up whatever hill
they’d decided to climb that August. But it is in Florida that we
have made some of our happiest memories over the years.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">In
1996, Mum and Dad decided to save for a ‘ONCE IN A LIFETIME trip’
to Orlando. Two years later we returned, then 3 years after that, and
three years after that, and roughly every 3 years following, until
this past 12 months where he managed to squeeze in two trips. It is a
magical place for us as a family and we have managed to convince a
few new converts in Scott, Stephen and Richard – and Oliver,
Hannah, Nathan and Eleanor of course – who recently named it as her
favourite place in the world. Our final trip together, whilst
eventful, will certainly now hold a special place in our hearts.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">So
far, you’ve heard the makings of a very busy man, and while that
was true, he always had time for his family as it grew, and he always
made time to spend with each of us individually. Weekends were spent
in the hills with Stewart in the 90’s, Stewart and Richard have
great memories of him from the golf course, Claire and I when we ran
marathons together. Alison and I spent sunny July days at Wimbledon,
Scott, freezing November days at Balmoor, and he enjoyed trips to
both Silverstone and SPA in Belgium with Stephen. And let’s not
forget the sound of Eddie Van-Halen’s jump that summoned him, at
least twice a day, for a phone call with Alison just to talk through
her latest thoughts.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">But
it is without a doubt that one of the greatest joys of his life was
meeting and spending time with his four grandchildren – Oliver,
Eleanor, Hannah and Nathan. Even on some of his hardest days he just
lit up when they came into the house, helping them to build
something, or draw something or play princesses. They made him so
proud, and they already follow in his footsteps: Oliver the talented
artist, Eleanor performing in her first musical this very evening,
Hannah with her independent streak and Nathan’s cheekiness – all
things they’ve inherited from their Papa. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">And
all this was shared with the love of his life, my Mum. I find it hard
to put into words what my Mum meant to my Dad, so instead I’m going
to use his own words from their silver wedding party speech:</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm">“<font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">you
see ladies and gentlemen, through all of that, through the good
times, and the tough times, the times when we had plenty, and the
times we didn’t, all I would have to do was to look at Christine,
and she would look into my eyes and tell me that she was right and I
was wrong, that it wasn’t her fault and it was certainly mine, that
I should watch that lamp-post in case it jumped out in front of the
car – and she might occasionally tell me that she loved me.”</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
always said they made quite a team, and they made quite a team.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">As
I said at the beginning, I could go on for days. But instead I’ll
leave you with a few final thoughts about Dad:</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
was a man who showed you he was really angry by talking through his
back teeth, and who threw all your clothes out the window if you
failed to tidy your bedroom.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
was a man of great musical talent, although this didn’t necessarily
extend to the piano, which he mostly chose to play, badly, when we
were late for something and needed to leave the house.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
was a man who you would see zipping around Peterhead with the roof of
his car down, even when it was only 10 degrees outside.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
could build the most magnificent structures from all the scrap bits
of wood from his garage – it may have looked like a boat from the
front, but in the back it was just a pile of sticks!</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
was a man who enjoyed nothing more than a midnight snack. In fact, he
once found himself at the South Road garage on Christmas Day because
he ate Claire’s starter – a tin of Heinz Tomato Soup – at 2 am.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
loved to watch Andy Murray play tennis, but would regularly hide in
the other room when he was playing a big match out of fear he’d
jinx the score.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
was, without a doubt, one of the worst dancers I have ever seen, who
(in spite of this fact) loved cutting shapes on the dance floor.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
was a man of strong faith, who lived his life in service. That
service took many forms, from playing and singing in the church band
and his love of hymns, to preaching at youth fellowship weekends
away, but mostly it was in the quiet way he offered a friendly ear to
a troubled soul, gave his time to those in need, or shared his wisdom
when you felt lost. It was also this faith that gave him his strength
to face his final days, fully trusting in God’s will – and it was
God’s will to call him home, where one day we’ll see him again. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Like
his father before him, he had a love of the minor prophets. A
favourite verse of Dad’s he always lived his life by was Micah 6 v
8</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">He
has showed you O man what is good. And what does the lord require of
you? To act justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your
God. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">I’ll
leave you with the words of Jonathan Larson, how do you measure the
life of such a man? </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">In
running, in painting, in frocks, in drams of whisky.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">In
family, in friends, in faith, in trips to Mickey.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt">Measure
in love.</font></p>
