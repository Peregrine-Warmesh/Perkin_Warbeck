          Smalls, Harpers, Kennedys, Campbells, Shields, family, friends, colleagues, fellow thespians, the task has fallen to me today to attempt to share with you the life of Dr Iain Robert Small. <BR>Discussing this fact with a friend this week, she concluded that if I told all the stories, we’d be here for a month. I think we can all agree we don’t have that long, so I’ll try my best to be succinct – but then again, I am my father’s daughter.

Iain Robert Small was born in Irvine, Ayrshire on 11th February, 1961 as the youngest of Ramsay and Aileen Small’s four boys.

His father, Ramsay, was a doctor who specialised in Public Health, and soon after Dad was born the family returned to Dundee as Ramsay had been appointed as the deputy medical officer of health for Tayside. On moving to Dundee, the family took up lifelong residence at 46 Monifieth Road.
<BR>
Life in Broughty Ferry was a happy one, but not without its trials for Dad. <BR>Being the youngest of 4 siblings is not an easy role – a fact our Alison would go in to discover for herself 30 years later. In fact, in the list of stories I received from my uncle Douglas earlier this week, he grouped them together under the sub-heading ‘tormenting’. <BR>A few small examples of this would be the time he was locked in the boot of a mini (an old mini mind – where the boot was roughly the size of a shoe box), the time his brother Kenneth ‘set’ a tray of fat drippings then cut it into squares and convinced Dad it was toffee, and Mum says I’m not allowed to tell the story about the bottle of lemonade…
<BR>


Nonetheless, he and his 3 brothers Ronald, Douglas and Kenneth (fondly known as Henry, Doug, Nyaff and Dad, Angie, – ask Doug!) also had a lot of fun together.

            Alison and I would often ask him to tell us about ‘when he was a little boy’. Our favourite was the tale of the dodgy VHF radios that came from Uncle John’s shop that actually broadcast locally over BBC 2, and on which the boys were mocking the accent of a particularly posh neighbour.



Dad was educated first at The Eastern Primary School, followed by Grove Academy, before obtaining his degree in medicine from the University of Dundee. From the age of 3 it was clear that he was a clever boy. One Saturday at about that age, my Granny took him on the bus into the town to do some shopping and somehow mother and son found themselves separated. After searching for Dad with no success, Granny decided the best thing to do was take the bus home to Broughty Ferry and phone my Papa. In the meantime, 3-year-old Iain went to a Police Box and told a policeman where his father worked, and so by the time Granny called Papa, Dad was already in his care.



It was in this house that Dad inherited his intelligence, his wisdom, his (sometimes brutal) honesty, his kindness, his love of music and the arts, and his faith. On moving to Broughty Ferry the family became the corner stone of Broughty Ferry Baptist Church and all 4 boys could be seen traipsing along St Vincent Street every Sunday morning, and evening, fully kilted, to attend the services there.

           He attended Sunday School there, and Crusaders then Youth Fellowship. In fact, it was at Crusaders that he picked up one of his signature preaching styles – how to turn a normal, everyday story into a message from scripture. In my house this was known as ‘the sneaky path’. And it was owing to this involvement with the young evangelical community in Dundee that Dad would embark on the other most important relationship in his life.

As Dad was still studying for his degree in medicine, the young family stayed with my grandparents at 46 Monifieth Road until 1983, when Dad became Dr Iain Small and they moved to Stracathro. 1984 brought with it a move to Monifieth, a job in Kings Cross in Dundee as a junior house officer, and a first daughter, me. Shortly after Claire was born in 1988, Dad became a GP and in 1989 our family made what would be the most significant move of our lives: to Peterhead.



Moving from their home in Dundee was difficult for Mum and Dad at first. They knew nobody, they had 3 very young children and their family all lived 100 miles away. So they threw themselves into the community who embraced us in return, and we met some of the most wonderful friends anyone could ask for – our Peterhead family. Many of you will be here today from those groups, and we’ve heard already about his work and the health centre, the football club, and his involvement in Rock Challenge and Panto. But there was also the Baptist Church – who can forget Tuesday evenings spent at Rocket Ship and Explorers – presenting on Waves Radio and Peterhead Athletics Club. When Alison was born in 1991, with now four children under 10, Dad decided he needed an excuse to be out of the house for 40 hours a week; marathon running was just that excuse.

         And he was good at it! Dad and I pounded out three marathons together. Obviously, this happened after his dislocated knee – there’s no way I was ever achieving the sort of pace that saw him take 2nd place at the Peterhead half in 1993 in 1hr 16mins and 29 seconds. He missed out on 1st place that day by 10 seconds, but he beat both John Robertson and Sandy Hastie: something he never let them forget. <BR>
<BR>He inspired so many people to join him in the 26.2 miles round London over the years. First Iain Harper, then me, Claire, Alison and Ben Harper. Even Mum was convinced to take her turn in 2012, with Dad her chief cheerleader. And Stewart… oh yeah, you haven’t done it Stewart, have you… yet! Our days of pain and torture around London are memories I’m sure none of us will never forget, with Dad supporting us all the way. He dragged me round my first, and I dragged him round his last.
<BR>
<BR>


Life in family Small was a full of fun and laughter. Our door was always open, and that led to a whole range of randoms spending as much time in our house as Dad did – Andy McLean, Stacey Dunn, Amy-Jo McLean, Rebekah Buchan. And many of them were also invited to share in one of Dad’s favourite past-times – his holidays. <BR>
<BR>There were caravan trips to Forfar, York and France, Cruises round the Med, the Middle East and the Caribbean, Cycling holidays, sailing holidays where we met the Mikkelsens, New York, Washington, Mexico, Dominican Republic. Family weekends away to Ballater, Huntly or Pitlochry were an annual highlight for Dad when he and my Uncles dragged us up whatever hill they’d decided to climb that August. But it is in Florida that we have made some of our happiest memories over the years.

In 1996, Mum and Dad decided to save for a ‘ONCE IN A LIFETIME trip’ to Orlando. Two years later we returned, then 3 years after that, and three years after that, and roughly every 3 years following, until this past 12 months where he managed to squeeze in two trips. It is a magical place for us as a family and we have managed to convince a few new converts in Scott, Stephen and Richard – and Oliver, Hannah, Nathan and Eleanor of course – who recently named it as her favourite place in the world. Our final trip together, whilst eventful, will certainly now hold a special place in our hearts.
<BR>
<BR>



So far, you’ve heard the makings of a very busy man, and while that was true, he always had time for his family as it grew, and he always made time to spend with each of us individually. Weekends were spent in the hills with Stewart in the 90’s, Stewart and Richard have great memories of him from the golf course, Claire and I when we ran marathons together. Alison and I spent sunny July days at Wimbledon, Scott, freezing November days at Balmoor, and he enjoyed trips to both Silverstone and SPA in Belgium with Stephen. And let’s not forget the sound of Eddie Van-Halen’s jump that summoned him, at least twice a day, for a phone call with Alison just to talk through her latest thoughts.
<BR>
<BR>

But it is without a doubt that one of the greatest joys of his life was meeting and spending time with his four grandchildren – Oliver, Eleanor, Hannah and Nathan. Even on some of his hardest days he just lit up when they came into the house, helping them to build something, or draw something or play princesses. They made him so proud, and they already follow in his footsteps: Oliver the talented artist, Eleanor performing in her first musical this very evening, Hannah with her independent streak and Nathan’s cheekiness – all things they’ve inherited from their Papa.
<BR>
<BR>

And all this was shared with the love of his life, my Mum. I find it hard to put into words what my Mum meant to my Dad, so instead I’m going to use his own words from their silver wedding party speech:
<BR>
<BR>

“you see ladies and gentlemen, through all of that, through the good times, and the tough times, the times when we had plenty, and the times we didn’t, all I would have to do was to look at Christine, and she would look into my eyes and tell me that she was right and I was wrong, that it wasn’t her fault and it was certainly mine, that I should watch that lamp-post in case it jumped out in front of the car – and she might occasionally tell me that she loved me.”
<BR>
<BR>

He always said they made quite a team, and they made quite a team.

     As I said at the beginning, I could go on for days. But instead I’ll leave you with a few final thoughts about Dad:

<BR>

He was a man who showed you he was really angry by talking through his back teeth, and who threw all your clothes out the window if you failed to tidy your bedroom.
<BR>


He was a man of great musical talent, although this didn’t necessarily extend to the piano, which he mostly chose to play, badly, when we were late for something and needed to leave the house.
<BR>


He was a man who you would see zipping around Peterhead with the roof of his car down, even when it was only 10 degrees outside.
<BR>


He could build the most magnificent structures from all the scrap bits of wood from his garage – it may have looked like a boat from the front, but in the back it was just a pile of sticks!
<BR>


He was a man who enjoyed nothing more than a midnight snack. In fact, he once found himself at the South Road garage on Christmas Day because he ate Claire’s starter – a tin of Heinz Tomato Soup – at 2 am.
<BR>


He loved to watch Andy Murray play tennis, but would regularly hide in the other room when he was playing a big match out of fear he’d jinx the score.

<BR>

He was, without a doubt, one of the worst dancers I have ever seen, who (in spite of this fact) loved cutting shapes on the dance floor.

<BR>

He was a man of strong faith, who lived his life in service. That service took many forms, from playing and singing in the church band and his love of hymns, to preaching at youth fellowship weekends away, but mostly it was in the quiet way he offered a friendly ear to a troubled soul, gave his time to those in need, or shared his wisdom when you felt lost. It was also this faith that gave him his strength to face his final days, fully trusting in God’s will – and it was God’s will to call him home, where one day we’ll see him again.
<BR>
Like his father before him, he had a love of the minor prophets. A favourite verse of Dad’s he always lived his life by was Micah 6 v 8

<BR>

He has showed you O man what is good. And what does the lord require of you? To act justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.

<BR>

I’ll leave you with the words of Jonathan Larson, how do you measure the life of such a man?

<BR>

In running, in painting, in frocks, in drams of whisky.

<BR>

In family, in friends, in faith, in trips to Mickey.


<BR>
Measure in love.
