<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Square Slice Boys</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The genesis of an artistic movement is often
easily identified in retrospect yet cloudy in prospect. When Rene Magritte
walked up to Henry Moore in that Moulin Rouge burlesque and asked to borrow
his pipe, not even the most prescient of Parisian prima donnas could have
heard the overture to the Dada movement that was playing behind the curtains.
Thus history will muse on the events of this week in the Walnut Cafe. The
square slice boys have known each other for upwards of 20 years. Yet instead
of forming an artistic movement, they have wasted their time on absurdly
loud music and home improvements. Only now, when they are perhaps hearing
the first hint of the call to the pavilion, have they allowed the muse
to tweak their luxuriant mustachios and begun to consider their place in
the tapestry. The dissolute pasts of the boys should not be plumbed, but
just for the record I proffer these pen-pictures</font>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Craig Smillie a.k.a. The Swan</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fitness fanatic and disciplinarian. All
his adult years, the Swan has heard the music that rides the winds from
the Well at the World’s End to his squalid South Side tenement. In his
case it came from some dodgy Springsteen bootlegs ululating with wow and
flutter and more hiss than Jim Davidson would get at Pride. Swan’s best
work combines his musical and artistic bents. “Big Caper reclining with
mandolin” for example, has the folk world agog with intrigue as to where
and when the sitting took place. Perhaps in a stovies fuelled post-gig
binge at Tarbert folk festival.</font></td>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">David McLachlan a.k.a. The Vicar</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Despite averring that all art is apolitical,
this vegetarian Feng Shui aficionado has recently been active in disparate
radical movements such as the Countryside Alliance and the William Wallace
Society for the Refurbishment of Elderslie (WWSRE). A slavish devotion
to his craft led him to enroll year after year in life drawing classes,
despite the teacher’s assurance that he had no more to learn. His calling
as a clergyman has provided him with 6 days off work a week. Most artists
would wallow in this luxury and produce canvas after canvas. The Vicar,
however has used the time to become an expert on the Spanish, Portugese,
Dutch and German football leagues via the 12 foot aerial in his manse garden.
This is not entirely art’s loss. The Pointillist “Mark Yardley hurdles
Roberto Carlos’ despairing tackle before rounding Iker Casillas” would
doubtless not be hanging in this expo without such research.</font></td>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Frank Boyle a.k.a. EL Generalissimo Franco</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">This ascetic Keith Richards lookalike is
elegantly wasted to the point where light itself seems to shine through
his all too fragile flesh. One can never be sure the former street fighter
has both feet planted in this world. One foot might be planted on the verdant
sod of Skibbereen or, more likely, the high arid ridges of the Atlas Mountains
to whence he repairs to fast and meditate. Light shines through his paintings
– which some have described as “net curtains only partially screening the
laws of physics”. In “Roll and Pie” for example, the crust of the pie is
so luminescent that one feels the very quantum vibrations of the pastry
are on show.&nbsp;</font></td>
