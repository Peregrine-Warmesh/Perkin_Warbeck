In the mid eighties, I was involved with an organisation called Frontier Youth Camps. <BR>Camping was provided to kids from what, in less enlightened times, we called deprived backgrounds. Camping was either under canvas or in rudimentary roofed accommodation. <BR>The organisation was technically a Christian one – although not evangelical. The ethos was more or less that the kids deserved a holiday – but didn’t need preached to.
<BR>I was also involved in a local Glasgow project that placed kids coming straight out of childrens’ homes in a supported living house. 
<BR>It was the brainchild of Ian Milligan, a social worker friend and neighbour, who had recognised the need for this type of accommodation.
<BR>Ian approached a local businessman for money / premises and got both!
<BR>This project was needing a new live-in worker.
<BR>At a training event for Frontier Youth Camps I was talking to a guy called Graham Aitken about our need for a worker. 
<BR>“I may know someone,” Graham said. Portentous words it transpired.
<BR>Graham was living in Aberdeen and said he would send this chap down for an interview. (It wasn’t really an interview).
<BR>And thus, with giant steps, Dave Hewitt walked into my life. 
<BR>He rather quickly latched onto the fact that I was a hillwalker of sorts and had a car. In a manner to which I would become accustomed he set about taking over aspects of my life.
Mainly hillwalking – but also social aspects.
<BR>He would turn up at the door a few times a week demanding tea, the Guardian and banter about the week’s events. Often he would have with him a couple of samosas, purchased in one of his many favourite Asian carry out shops. 
<BR>The housing project gave him a roof and a meagre stipend. I was always amazed at how little he could live on. Give him some sardines and a few custard creams…..

<BR>The housing project duties allowed Dave to go hitching midweek – he wrote a pean to hitching in the first issue of the Angry Corrie.
<BR>At weekends he would browbeat me into Munro bagging.
<BR>The supported housing project had rooms for two young people. Two I remember were a Celtic casual and a guy who ran off to the circus. Dave would comment to the Celtic casual on a new jumper.
<BR>“Eighty”, the guy would reply. The more expensive the better. There was obviously a big disconnect here as Dave was not really known as Beau Brummel.
<BR>After his stint at the project, he was gainfully employed at Stopover - a hostel for young homeless people. This possibly finally satisifed his mother’s desire that he have a “proper job”.
<BR>The social workers  there had no idea about IT and Dave decided it would be a good thing if I created and maintained a database of the residents, to manage their interface with the benefit system etc. 
It would never get past GDPR regulations these days.
But I would visit one night a week to develop it and met various residents and staff. It was a very admirable institution.


There was a resident in Stopover I shall never forget. He was – I think – what would be described as non-binary these days.  He regularly wore a wedding dress. He frequented the gay clubs in Glasgow – particularly Club-X.
Dave had a particular rapport with him which was lovely to watch. The resident was profoundly deaf and did most of his communication by handwriting. 
I recall a one liner that Dave and I would laugh about to this day. Stopover had a trainee social worker who was Greek. He was called Panos. The aforementioned resident once wrote to Dave – “Panos is Egypt.”
Dave would occasionally take staff or residents hillwalking. I recall an ascent of Ben Lomond where one young girl had an insult for every single person she met on the ascent. Some of them would “growl” back at her, as she described it.

Dave Hewitt and I did much hillwalking together as a twosome. A lot of it was Munro bagging – although I never aspired to completion. He was forever inventing connections between hills and routes down that were not the same as the routes up. One would have to admit this last habit wasn’t always endearing when there was a perfectly good path and we were elsewhere on scree or heather. 
He was always fast – big long legs and years worth of fitness in his legs. I was fit too, in those days - running, hockey, cycling , badminton – but he was always faster. This was further exemplified in snow, because he weighed about the same as me – but had far larger feet by about 4 sizes. So he would float along the neve and I would plunge in.

 Once when we were doing a couple of Munros via the West Highland railway line that involved chasing a train at the end – he insisted that we visit some obscure bothy off on a side path. I still recall the sprint back – him always ahead as we chased that last train. 
Where I was able to take a rare lead was when it came to scrambling. The big man was not well disposed to it – partly because his long legs and arms pushed his centre of gravity out from the rock. But I am six feet two – so it wasn’t only that. He was a bit fearty. On the Aonach Egach, at a particularly tricky pinnacle, I took Dave’s rucksack as well as my own to aid him in his teetering progress. On Sgurr Alasdair- in wet snow, he ended up taking the hands of both me and Linda – a person of barely five feet. This feartiness culminated in two rebuffs by the Inaccessible Pinnacle. I was pleased to be with him when he finally mocked that usurper.
