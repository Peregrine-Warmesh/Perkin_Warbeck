<center><b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=+3>Grolsch: a tribute
page</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Grolsch has just left us. He was a grand
old dog and it seemed only fitting to create a semi-permanent presence
for him on the web as his presence had been so forceful in his life. he
did as they say in Dundee "think he was Erchie"</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Examples of this:</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Barking at the horse and pig (2 inanimate
wooden play objects in the area of Pollokshields known as "the horse and
pig park"</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stealing a whole box of Goodfellow's chocolate
violets. (This is akin to eating a whole tin of Nestle's condensed milk.
OK I know some people do this, namely The Swan)</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sitting on the white leather seats of Bob
Medding's Jaguar</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Stealing traffic cones from roadwroks and
terrorising them</font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Not forgetting the time he left his abode in Westmoreland St and crossed both Victoria Rd and Pollokshaws Rd (alone) to visit Bridie</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, here a few pictures by which to remember
him. These are thumbnails, click for the full res.</font>
