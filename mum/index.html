July 1928, the daughter of Anson Masterton and Helen, nee McKay. She
was the younger of their two children, and, no doubt, something of a
pleasant surprise, or perhaps a shock, her brother John having been
born 14 years earlier.  </font>

Although
John and Aileen remained close siblings for all their lives together,
until he died at the grand old age of 93, he was, being that bit
older, a terrible tease. &#8220;Your name isn&#8217;t really Aileen
Masterton&#8221; he would tell her, in his characteristically hoarse
voice &#8220;it&#8217;s Baileen Murgatroyd, and your nose is as long as the
Tay Bridge. Everyone else can see it but you&#8221;.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">The
family lived in Downfield, in Dundee. Anson was at that time a
pattern maker at Robb Caledon shipyard, before taking over what, for
decades, and through three generations would be the Masterton family
business. Initially a Greengrocer and latterly known as &#8220;Johnny
Ahthin&#8217;s, Masterton&#8217;s was, and still is on the corner of Arklay
Street and Clepington Road. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">After
a short spell in Mains Loan, the family did what many shopkeepers do,
and lived &#8216;above the shop&#8217;. After primary school and the infamous
&#8216;Eleven plus&#8217;, Aileen was educated at Morgan Academy, where she
excelled academically and in music. Willowy of stature, her leather
music satchel, gifted by her proud parents, carried her initials-
A.S.M. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Hey&#8221;
the boys would taunt  &#8220;what does that stand for? Affy Skinny
Mesterton&#8221;. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Although
schooldays were at the Morgan, Sundays were for Herman Hall, where
Anson was a regular leader and contributor, and where a lifelong
grounding in Aileen&#8217;s Christian faith was born. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">It&#8217;s
worth remembering that those were the days that led up to the Second
World War. John went off to join the RAF, leaving Aileen as a 12 year
old girl, out with her friends, when the bombs fell on Baxter Park
and the Taybank works. She ran all the way home, fearful that the
bomber was trying to hit her and her alone. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">After
the war, and after the Morgan, came University. An unusual thing for
a woman in those days, particularly when she chose to study Maths and
Sciences. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">And
along with studying at the University of St Andrews, came romance. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">By
that time, Aileen had been Baptised by full emersion in the Hermon
Hall. The elderly man tasked with the joyous duty took one look at
this tall young woman before him, then whispered </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Lassie
Eh&#8217;ll put ye under but as for getting back up, you&#8217;re on yer
ain&#8217;&#8221; </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">At
that time there was a thriving group of young Christians, coming from
the Evangelical churches in the centre of the city- Hermon, Ward Road
and Rattray Street Baptist Churches, and the &#8216;Tent Mission&#8217;. A
favourite adventure was to head off to the Kessock Convention in the
Lake District, a residential Bible Study summer school that still
thrives to this day.  It was there that the young Aileen would begin
a romance with an even younger medical student who was church
organist and choirmaster at Rattray Street Baptist Church. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">When
Ramsay George Small came a courting, Anson would often be putting out
the shop cats, and would catch them canoodling in the closie (a tale
shared more than 70 years later with way too much detail). &#8220;Hey&#8221;
he would shout &#8220;Eh&#8217;ll chase ye&#8221; before sending Ramsay sprinting
down Arklay Street towards the safety of home. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Anson,
who was to leave Granny Masterton a widow far too young, had a
wonderful turn of phrase. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">See
her&#8221; he once said of the woman across the lobby- &#8220;half of her
lees are no true&#8221;. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Married
to Ramsay in Rattray Street on 29th September 1951 Aileen had crossed
the invisible divide between Bretheren and Baptist, never to return. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">They
set up home in their flat on Lochee Road, although I pity the removal
men who had to get her Baby Grand Piano up three flights of stairs. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Ramsay
was still a student, so Aileen was to be the bread winner.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Having
graduated with an Honours B.Sc,, and clutching her Post Graduate
Teaching Certificate, she set off into the world of teaching in 1950,
at Logie School in the west end of Dundee. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">After
Ramsay&#8217;s graduation, family would follow- Ronald in 1954, and
Douglas a year later. Home was still Lochee Road, and with Ramsay
working the kind of killer hours that Junior Doctors did in those
days, a well deserved Saturday long lie was worth coveting, although
not, when you live in a flat, at the expense of your two toddler
children deciding to make a paddling pool of your living room floor
while you slept. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">The
family moved around after that- National Service in Crail saw them
based in Anstruther, then after Kenneth came along in 1958, a move to
the west- Kenmuir Street Glasgow then Irvine Ayrshire, where the last
of their boys was born. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Returning
to Dundee in 1961 was a move with mixed emotions. Her mother Helen
(or Nellie, or Lala as she liked to be known) was by now a widow, and
missed her daughter. At the same time, a job as Deputy Medical
Officer for Health was a Public Health opportunity for Ramsay that
would prove to be the beginning of an impressive and influential
career. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">But
where to stay? Four growing boys, bursting with energy, up to pranks
and high jinks. Broughty Ferry it was then, and thus began an almost
60 year association with 46 Monifieth Road, a home purchased for the
dazzling price of £1,850. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Just
as significantly, thus began an almost 60 year association with
Broughty Baptist Church. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Broughty
Baptist, at that time, was teetering on the point of closure. Its
faithful but tiny membership was one prayer meeting short of closing
the doors.  In fact Reg Burgess the church Secretary had prayed &#8220;Lord
send us a family that can carry on the work of this Church or it is
finished&#8221;. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Then,
weeks later, in walked (or in my case prammed) the Smalls. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Through
the 60&#8217;s the four be-kilted Small boys were a common sight walking
down St Vincent Street on a Sunday morning, and again on a Sunday
evening. Even the live broadcast of the 1970 World Cup final was not
an acceptable reason for missing the evening service. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">If
you were good, there was a tube of Rowantree Fruit Gums from Betty
Kinloch, if you weren&#8217;t, there was &#8216;that look&#8217; from mum, and
the threat of the &#8216;yard stick&#8217; when you got home. This mighty
metre of Walnut, brass tipped at either end, had been Anson&#8217;s
measure from his ship building days, and struck more fear into our
hearts than mum&#8217;s Lochgelly tawse- she was laughably useless at
giving anyone the belt. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Church
life saw Ramsay become a regular preacher, and church Secretary for
Decades, as well as being an active member of the Broughty Churches
Council and, in 1973, President of the Baptist Union of Scotland.
Aileen threw herself into the Sunday School, the WA, anything that
needed done frankly, before becoming one of the first women Deacons
in Scottish Baptist history.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">1960&#8217;s
holidays for the family beggar belief. Rather than take these four
hyperactive boys somewhere exciting, we got wet cold Strontian, even
wetter colder Skye, and the absolute nadir of Small vacations,
Poolewe Wester Ross. Aileen would kit us out in hand knitted jumpers,
anoraks from John&#8217;s shop, and rainmates- yes- boys in rainmates-
[even more embarrassing than the kilts]- before sending us out into
the fields to be sacrificed to the midgies and the cleggs and the
every present always pouring rain. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">A
marginal compensation for such summertime torture was a walk &#8216;down
the ferry&#8217; to Goodfellows for a box of Chocolate Violets. On one
such occasion Aileen and her mother were stopped by a stranger. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Are
these 4 boys all yours&#8221; she asked</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Yes
they are&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">fower
bairns, and all of them boys&#8230; what a tragedy&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">At
which point, Nellie, hackles up pitched in. &#8220;Well she doesn&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s a tragedy&#8221;.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">On
reflection, when I think of what we put her through, I often wonder
if the stranger had a point. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Nellie
also paid for Aileen&#8217;s driving lessons- all of them, and there were
many, passing her test on the 4</font><sup><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">th</font></sup><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">

father tried to teach her the skill of driving that he himself had
barely mastered.  Perhaps those days were be the first airing of his
regular outburst of </font>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">The
&#8216;70&#8217;s brought a return to teaching, at Stobswell then the Grove,.
This decade also brought the fashion disaster that was the Bright Red
Crimpoline Trouser Suit. To be fair, holidays had been upgraded to
Cornwall and Devon, although the 70&#8217;s also saw the first appearance
of the infamous &#8216;blue rinse&#8217;. </font>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Long
before Mollie Sugden had brought Mrs Slocombe to the screens in &#8216;Are
you being served&#8217;, Aileen&#8217;s prematurely white hair (a family gift
available to all generations) had developed an odd, and strangely
purple hue. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Being
a pupil at the same school where your mum teaches is, shall we say,
an acquired taste. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Hey
Smallie- your mum&#8217;s got purple hair&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">I
know that, did you think I hadn&#8217;t noticed&#8221;?</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Eh

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">I
know that, do you think I hadn&#8217;t noticed- but just remember, it&#8217;s
me that&#8217;s marking your Ink Exercises&#8221;.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">The
70&#8217;s also brought a departure from the &#8216;yardstick&#8217;, as an
increasingly difficult Doug forced his mother into the ultimate
equaliser- the hairbrush. Now Doug claims that one of these was once
broken on his head, and I do remember enjoying the spectacle, but to
be fair, he must have deserved it.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Hitting
&#8216;that certain age&#8217; with us lot in the house must have been
exasperating. Waterfights on the house roof, cricket balls through
bedroom windows, neighbours at the door following apple plundering
expeditions, and of course the infamous illegal UHF radios with which
we broadcast cheeky comments about neighbours on the same wavelength
as BBC2!</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">On
one infamous occasion, prompted by an argument about the driving
rights to the wee red mini, Ronald exclaimed in desperation &#8220;oh
give me a knife&#8221;! &#8220;With pleasure&#8221; was Aileen&#8217;s equally
exasperated reply.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">But
these difficult days, like number 10 Busses, passed by Monifieth Road

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">These
9 were much loved, much provided for, taxi-d to clubs and outings,
enrolled in the Girls Burgade (well the girls anyway), where Aileen
had become an Officer. They were even permitted to re-create the
paddling pool incident at Granny and Papa&#8217;s house, and were, in
general-spoiled and supported nurtured and nourished.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">On
the subject of nourishment, it&#8217;s a wonder, mind you, that any of us
are here today. Aileen&#8217;s kitchen could never be described as a
shining example of infection control. In fact shining isn&#8217;t a word
I would commonly associate with her kitchen at all!  In that place,
sell by dates have always been an irrelevance, milk would be off when
it smelt off, her home made jam would have the mould scraped off
before spreading- or pouring- onto toast, and all done in a kitchen
where the washing dried above the cooking fat on a pulley system
forever referred to as &#8220;the sticks&#8221;. </font>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Going
to school with clothes smelling of bacon and egg was a common
occurrence, and it was only after getting married myself that I
realised that you could actually buy purpose made dusters, rather
than recycling an old pair of dad&#8217;s underpants for the task.  </font>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">But
I digress. The family were now scattered across Scotland, in Glasgow,
Carluke, Perth and Peterhead, so the freedom brought about by
retirement for Ramsay and Aileen allowed them not only to visit their
growing family, but to travel extensively, first in the UK, and
latterly, putting her legendary fear of open water to one side, on
the continent.  </font>

<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">A
woman who wouldn&#8217;t get on the &#8216;Fifie&#8217; if there were white
horses in the Tay set aside her fears so that Ramsay, her husband of
all those years, could sit drinking coffee in St Mark&#8217;s Square
Venice, and watch the sun go down on Galway Bay. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">And
the dying of the light over Western Ireland was mirrored by the
reality of their 52 year partnership. All marriages end in tears.
There is a time for everything, and everything in its time, and so it
was that this Golden couple would be separated, if only for a season.
When our father died in 2003, she bore grief and the single life that
followed with courage, fortitude, stubbornness and grace. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">There
was a side to Aileen that could seem perhaps hard, or even stern. One
good friend once described her to me &#8220;a force to be reckoned with&#8221;.
</font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">This
practical woman could switch off her emotions with a skill that I
envy. On the day Ramsay died, he had just gone over to the Post Box
to post a year&#8217;s subscription to &#8216;Sea Breezes&#8217;- a shipping
journal whose presence on the living room coffee table was a constant
irritation to her. By teatime that very day, the subscription had
been cancelled. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">And
so to the next chapter of her life- not the happiest- she missed
Ramsay stoically in her own deep way, but by no means unrewarding.
There were things to celebrate, Sheila and Doug&#8217;s marriage brought
her another loving daughter in law into the family, then there was
the arrival of Simon, and all his joinery skills, and of course Freya
and Hamish her first two Great Grandchildren.  </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Supported
by dear friends, - and you know who you are, she still ventured out
in her wee purple Daihatsu.  She was a common site at Jessie&#8217;s
Kitchen, Cambstay, and Forbes of Kingennie, and she single handedly
kept the Brown Street Markies food court in business.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">And
of course there was always the constant presence of the church. The
WA, of which she had, of course been national President, her home
Bible Study Group that she continued after Ramsay&#8217;s death and her
support for the Baptist Missionary Society and Leprosy Mission and
much much more. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Of
course, her later years were tinged with a sadness that was hard to
bear. The loss of Ronald, her first wee boy in 2011, was a blow that
hit her harder, perhaps, than that of the death of his father Ramsay.
</font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Following
on from there, the insidious loss of her own cognitive function left
her a mere shadow of the &#8216;force of nature&#8217; she had once been. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">In
the early days her forgetfulness went un-noticed- she had always
tended to tell you the same stories on a 15 minute loop anyway, but
that was to change when she took out half of the former Dundee United
football team in the Purple flying machine one Easter Sunday just up
the road from her house. It became clear to us, and to her, that
something had gone awry. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Not
that she wouldn&#8217;t go down fighting- I remember one day going into
her house, and there she was, sat in the window as usual. She was
muttering to herself;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">David

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">I
raised an eyebrow in query</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">That
mental health nurse is coming to see how demented I am and she always
asks me who the Prime Minister is. Well I&#8217;m going to show her this
time&#8221;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8220;<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Ask
her to solve a Quadratic equation mum, and see how she gets on with
that&#8221;. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">At
this point she showed me that she could still solve a Quadratic
Equation- the old way.. of course. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Following
on from a Hogmany fall that fractured her neck of femur almost three
years ago, her days of being able to live independently were over.
Increasingly hard of hearing, but still with her fantastic wit and
her stock of stories from the old days, the light was slowly dimming.
In these latter days, she was cared for by a staff at Riverview who
were truly fond of her, and visited faithfully by family and her
dearest friends.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">It&#8217;s
funny, but in her later, and quite joyously forgetful days,  three
things that characterised her throughout her life remained- her love
of a cup of tea, her even greater love of cake, and her oddly
endearing habit of shoving paper tissues up the sleeve of her
cardigan. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Towards
the end of her life, she looked forward to two things- being 90, and
being away. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">She
achieved the former in July, and the latter on 13</font><sup><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">th</font></sup><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">
October. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">There&#8217;s
an old medical rule about gallstones called the rule of &#8216;F&#8217;s. Now
it&#8217;s worth noting that gallstones came close to being the end of
our mother 20 years ago, so I hope that, as you&#8217;ve listened to this
gentle meandering through the 90 years of Aileen Small&#8217;s life you
will have picked up on three F&#8217;s that defined her. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Friendships- lasting, life
long friendships with many of you here, and many who have already
died.  Neighbours like Alan and Betty Inglis, and of course Gordon
and Edith Wilson, her teaching colleagues, &#8216;the Morgan girls&#8217;,
the Cinderella girls- so called because they were never home before
midnight, the McCrackens, Hoggs, Rodgers, Campbells and many more.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Family-
she loved her brother and her parents, embraced the menagerie that
was and is the Small clan, and sat as the driving force and centre of
the four generations that started with her four wee boys, and whose
most recent additions, Frankie and Oliver became her third and fourth
Great Grandchildren, within the last few weeks. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">And
then there was Faith- and such a faith, never wavering, even in the
darkest days of Ramsay and Ronald, even after losing her own father
when she was only 30. A faith that helped to rescue a dying Church
fellowship and through the Spirit of God moving in that place has
seen generations since find their own faith too.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">And
so as we meet together to look back and celebrate her life, thankful
for what it brought to each of ours, I&#8217;m reminded, as I hope we all
are, that this was a long life well lived, and a life of one much
loved. </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">I&#8217;ve
marked on my notes at this point- nae greetin&#8217;. Those would be my
mothers words not mine. So rather than greetin&#8217; this is a time for
celebrating, or as Mum would have said- </font>
