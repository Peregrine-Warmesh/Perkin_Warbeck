<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">There&#8217;s
an old family friend of ours who once summed up the essence of
Dignity as being about Work, Faith and Home.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Our
brother Ronald was, above all else, a very dignified man, and I want
to share with you some of the aspects of his life that made him the
person he was, starting from where Moraig has left off, and
broadening out into these three areas.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Each
of us will have personal memories, favourite moments and stories, and
we as a family have gone through lots of them over the past few days
and weeks. We are particularly grateful to our brother Doug, who has
spent hours over the past few months picking out favourite childhood
memories from our Dad&#8217;s extensive 35mm slide collection and posting
them on Facebook, and also for putting together the album you&#8217;ve
seen this afternoon.</span><br>

<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"> </font></div>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Although
much of what I plan to say today is a formal recognition of our
brother&#8217;s life and work, I will intersperse this with some personal
memories and anecdotes, where they seem apt.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Ronald
George was born in Maryfield Hospital on the 1</font><sup><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">st</font></sup><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">
of August 1954, the first of four sons to parents Ramsay and Aileen
Small. He was born at an interesting time, his father had just
started work as a House Doctor in Residence at Stracathro Hospital,
near Brechin, and the family home was a flat in Lochee Road, Dundee.
In those days, long before the European Working Directive, his father
used to get every third weekend off, and that only started on a
Saturday morning. On a rare weekday evening off, he would catch a bus
into Brechin, another to Dundee, spend about an hour with his wife
and new son, and get back on the bus, as he had to be back on call by
midnight.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Childhood
days were spent in Lochee Road, Anstruther, and Irvine Ayrshire,
during which the young Ronald was joined by his three wee brothers,
Douglas, Kenneth and Iain. </span><br>
</font></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="kilt" src="DSC00864.resized.JPG"></font><br>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Ronald and Douglas were a good team, their
crowning childhood achievement must be the morning when, with
exhausted parents both asleep, they turned the second floor living
room carpet of the Lochee road flat into a paddling pool, pouring
bucket after bucket of water through the floorboard cracks onto the
ceiling below.. I don&#8217;t think the wifie doon stairs was too happy!</span><br>
</font></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Different Swimming Pool</font><br>
</div>


<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Moving
to 46 Monifieth Road Broughty Ferry in 1961, Ronald was educated (or
at least they tried) at Eastern School and Grove Academy. His
impressive collection of Complimentary O Grades is a testimony to his
life long qualities of persistence and perseverance, and it was while
trying, again, to gain a Higher English that he put Technical down on
his curriculum, simply to fill out the page. This was a life defining
moment, as under the guidance and mentorship of Walter Miles
Principal teacher in that subject, he had discovered his true
aptitude and vocation.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Four
years at Dundee College of Further education followed, and after
graduating, he began his professional career in Auchterarder.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">At
this point, of course, he became Mr Small, the Techy teacher.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">It&#8217;s
been interesting to talk to many of you over this past week or two,
and to hear our brother referred to as Ron, Ronny, as well as Ronald.
Some here may think of him as &#8216;the heedie&#8217;, and of course he was
also Dad, Vater, Grandad. and somewhat bizarrely Uncle Orange! </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">His
proper name, of course, is none of these. The name by which he was
known to us all in childhood, and still is to some, was Henry. Why?
Those avid readers of the Broons will know that Hen Broon is a lanky,
skinny, uncoordinated dreep of a young man&#8230; Those of you who have
seen those adolescent photographs will recognise that if the bunnet
fits&#8230;.then jings and crivens, just wear it.</span><br>
<br>
</font></p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Before he got too long and skinny</span><br>
</div>

<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">What
you may not know is that his full, official nickname was Henry the
Parrot. This comes from the occasion of an infamous water fight, when
we three boys, Doug, Kenneth and Iain, together with the usual
suspects, the neighbourhood ne-er do wells, had extended our war zone
beyond the mere horizontal. Our parents had a rare night off, and
were at a friends&#8217; house for dinner.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">The
phone at the friends&#8217; house rings, and Henry-the parrot- Small
interrupts the party</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8216;<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">squawk,
Douglas is on the roof&#8217; says he&#8230;. Ah well, punishment by
yardstick over the backside again.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Following
marriage to Sandra, they set up their family home in Maple Road
Perth, and with the move came membership of Perth Baptist Church,
then situated in a converted Victorian theatre in Tay Street. If work
was an area in which, as you will hear, he achieved great things,
serving God through testing times has also been a recurring theme for
more than 30 years.<br>

<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><br>
Gaining
promoted posts at both Perth Schools, first the High and then the
Academy, the family (as now they were with the arrival of Moraig and
Fiona) remained in Perth during the years of low church
membership&#8230;.the small church struggling with the duties and
financial responsibilities of owning a Listed building. </font>
</p>

<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">One
day, Ronald and his pastor, Jack Quinn, were up at the church manse,
which was situated on Glasgow Road, looked over the Perth Skyline. A
pall of smoke was rising from the town centre;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8216;<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">wouldn&#8217;t
it be an answer to prayer if that was the church going up in smoke&#8217;
said one to the other</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Indeed
it was, although as I recall, the Perth Constabulary took a bit of
convincing that God had had a hand in it, rather than one of them.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">There
followed a period of holy homelessness, which ultimately saw the
rebirth of Perth Baptist, on the high ground to the west of town. The
seeds had been sown by Jack Quinn and were harvested by Ken Jefferson
and Charles Young. I know the number of hours that Ronald, along with
the rest of the Perth team put into that project, and it&#8217;s a lesson
to be learned that shortly after completion, with the new church
established, and with the promised land in sight, that Ronald was
successful in gaining a position as Principal Teacher at Arbroath
High School, leaving the Perth fellowship with the job completed.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">These
were happy years, first in Solway Gardens and latterly Wemyss
Crescent Monifieth. Years of camping.. yes I know, Sandra camping&#8230;.
Caravanning, long summer treks to France and Italy, of family outings
through the Larig Gru, climbing Curved Ridge on the Buchaille Etive
Mhor, and Sunrise bacon butties at the top of Shehallion.<br>
</font></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><img style="width: 514px; height: 768px;" alt="cr" src="roncrvrdg.resized.jpg"><img style="width: 512px; height: 768px;" alt="cr" src="curvedridgers.resized.jpg"></font><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Curved Ridge</span></font><br>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"> Years of
lunchtime teachers volleyball, and weekends in Huntly, Aberdeenshire,
one of his favourite places. Ronald spent happy evenings standing by
the river Deveron with Simon, his son in law, his brothers, and Freya
and Hamish, his grand-children, in whom he delighted. And then there
were those legendary Arbroath High School Variety Shows. Santa&#8217;s
usual mode of transportation, as every child knows, is a sleigh
pulled by reindeer. The Arbroath version, however, arrives laden with
gifts on the back of the cleaner&#8217;s floor polishing machine.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Throughout
those years, Ronald&#8217;s skill with wood meant a steady stream of
bespoke children&#8217;s toys, trucks, cots and doll&#8217;s houses, played
to death by nephews and nieces, ornaments, display cabinets and
furniture, and latterly those remote controlled model boats. </span><br>
</font></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="rc" src="huntly.JPG"></font><br>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Look
around the Living room in what is still the epicentre of the Small
family in Monifieth Road, and you will find his craftsmanship in
every corner.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">When
they arrived in Monifieth, Ronald and Sandra re-joined the fellowship
at Broughty Baptist, where he had been baptised in the early 1970&#8217;s,
and began what was to be almost 20 years of faithful service. In a
manner somewhat reminiscent of the politics of North Korea, he
stepped into his father&#8217;s shoes, at one time or another serving as
deacon, Chairman and Secretary.  He also, being a lifelong
left-hander, played a mean upside down guitar, in the praise band
Accord, who are playing today.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">During
this time, his professional career flourished. Under the support and
guidance of his great friends and Head Teachers, the late John White
and Alan Fraser, and building on the foundation of years of work with
the Scottish Exam Board, and latterly Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of
Schools. He became Deputy Head Teacher at Arbroath, and finally Head
Teacher in Montrose. Nae bad for a wee laddy who sat every English
Exam he ever did using Dulce et Decorum Est, as his poetry text. No
wonder he started as a woodwork teacher.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">I
think my favourite work related tale from this time was of a school
parents evening at Arbroath high. A colleague was ill, so Ronald had
a &#8216;please take&#8217; parents&#8217; night, not an easy task. Having sat a
set of parents down, he went through the academic performance of
their son, his aptitudes and difficulties, suggesting ways in which
he could perform better, and ways in which they, his parents, could
help.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8216;<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Mr
Small, that&#8217;s very helpful, and you&#8217;ve summed up our child very
well&#8217;, said the father, &#8216;the only problem is, she&#8217;s our
daughter&#8217;.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Sadly, his time as Head
teacher in Montrose was to be cut short by illness, a fact that
frustrated him, as he felt, as did we all, that he had much to give,
and that he had had finally arrived in the role for which he had
served such a long and fitting apprenticeship. He was born to be a
leader, an encourager, and he trained to have patience, empathy and
to see the potential in others. Like his father before him, he wasn&#8217;t
one to suffer fools gladly, but he seldom judged anyone a fool, and
saw no child, or teacher, as being beyond redemption.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">And
so we come to the end of Ronald&#8217;s earthly journey. The same
qualities of patience determination and resolve that helped him to
bring out the best in generations of pupils and colleagues were
evident throughout his final year. His hillwalking buddies will tell
you that even in the thickest of hill fog, when you couldn&#8217;t see
the end of your nose&#8230; a remarkable thing in his case&#8230; Ronald
would always look skyward and declare</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8216;<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">it&#8217;s
brightening up mind you&#8217;.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">So
it was in his later days</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8216;<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">how
are you then?&#8217;</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8216;<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">yeh
I&#8217;m fine, yeh really, I&#8217;m fine&#8217;.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Ever
practical, he ensured that his family were set up in their new home
before leaving them. The only blips in this sensible approach were
when his post chemotherapy steroid induced spending binges kicked in,
often in Gillies&#8217;s of Broughty Ferry, as the trees worth of
recently purchased solid oak furniture in the new house can prove.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">Eventually
Ronald left us on Saturday 17</font><sup><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">th</font></sup><font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">
December 2011, having spent his final hours with Sandra and the
girls. But I know, as did he, that his story doesn&#8217;t end there.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> <font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4">His
was a story of Work, and of Home, and of Faith, and, to quote his
favourite poet, well lets face it, the only poet he ever read, what
happened on a cold winter&#8217;s afternoon in Roxburghe House was not
the end, but simply a drawing down of blinds. </font>
