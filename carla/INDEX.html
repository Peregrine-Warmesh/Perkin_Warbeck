<h4>Carla's song is the latest film directed by Ken Loach. It is a rather
unique collaboration with first-time scriptwriter Paul Laverty. Paul was
in Nicaragua in the late eighties at the height of the war waged by the
USA-backed Contras. His experiences there as a human rights lawyer prompted
him to try and communicate some of what he had seen in a film script. With
the naivete of the innocent he sent his script straight to Ken Loach and
Carla's Song is the result.</h4>

<td>“I was writing lots of articles for small human rights organisations”,
recalls Laverty,(second left in the image) “and eventually, I decided ‘That’s
it! I’ve really got to try and get a story out to a bigger audience!’ </td>

<td>In my naivety, I decided I would try and write a film script. “Most
people said ‘You must be daft! First of all, you haven’t written a script
before. Secondly, you think you’re going to get a feature film made in
Nicaragua. And thirdly, it’s going to have a political element: you must
be stupid!’ But, in a way, I didn’t really care. I’m not trying to be brass-necked
about it but, if you feel passionate about something, you’ve got to get
it out.” The route Laverty chose to turn what he learned into a film led
him, almost inevitably, to Ken Loach. “I wrote to Ken about six years ago
out of the blue,” he recalled on the Glasgow set of the film, “and he said,
‘Let’s meet up and have a good chat’.”</td>

<p>The fim is set in Glasgow and Nicaragua. While political in the broad
sense like most of Loach's films , it is essentially a story of the love
of a Glasgow bus driver George (Robert Carlyle) for the eponymous Carla
(Oyanka Cabezas)</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>

<td>Carla is a dancer who has fled Nicaragua after her group was ambushed
by Contras. George chances upon her busking, while driving his bus along
St Vincent Street; he duly abandons his bus to pursue her acquaintance.

<p>“It’s important to me that I do this film very well,” adds Cabezas.
“For some reason, I feel very, very close to Carla, even though I never
had these kinds of experiences, I think it is because I, Oyanka, am representing
my country.”</p>

<td>The two are soon canoodling at the back of what was then a Strathclyde
Regional Transport bus. Local government reorganistaion has left me unsure
what to call it now. While Carla is seen out of her depth in Glasgow's
cold and rain, it is nothing to George's shock when he sees the Contras
at first hand. Laverty is at pains to stress that there is nothing the
Contras do in the film that he did not either witness or have documentary
evidence to support.</td>

<td>A film could not be set in Nicaragua without some effort to address
the global circumstances which caused this nation of two and a half million
to be centre stage for most of the Reagan years. Such polemicism as there
is, is delivered by Scott Glen who plays Bradley, a disillusioned CIA operative
who has to take George through a crash course in the Langley, Virginia
way of death.“He was immensely plucky,” says Loach of Glenn. “He went and
learned Spanish, which was great, because the character would have been
able to speak Spanish. And, in a short space of time, he became all the
things that the character would have been.” </td>

<td>There is a certain irony in this film coming to light in 1997, for
the Nicaraguan people appear, for the time being, to have severed electoral
knot with Sandinistas who are the unseen heroes of the film, having revolutionised
the country which was in the words of Oxfam "the threat of a good
example"</td>

<h2><b>Some quotes</b></h2>

<p>Carla's Song was awarded a gold medal at the Italian Film Festival in
Venice. The judges, led by <b>Roman Polanski</b>, gave the film the award
for what they saw as the way "it best underlies civil progress and
solidarity".</p>

<p>Accepting the award in Venice, <b>Paul Laverty</b> said: "In a
truly civilised world the two ex-presidents of the United States, George
Bush and Ronald Reagan, would be tried for their crimes against humanity
in Central America ; there's a better chance Scotland might win the next
World Cup. What comes to mind is an old peasant organiser I met in Central
America. He worked in really dangerous areas, but despite the ever-present
threat of violence he was full of optimism and conviction. As I left he
shook my hand and said: `Join our grain of sand'. This solidarity medal
from the Venice jury honours the memory of that old man and the thousands
of others like him who continue to organise ... who continue to believe
it's possible to put people and community before profit."</p>

<p><b>Ken Loach</b>.."It's important to rescue the past and tell that
story (Nicaragua in the eighties) It's important to share the trauma that
the people of Nicaragua went through, and acknowledge it."</p>

<p><b>Scott Glenn</b>. “It was the most exciting, vital way of working
that I’ve ever run into. I told Ken at the end of the film that I’d been
waiting 27 years to work with him.”</p>

<td>Carlyle on filming in Nicaragua ....
<p>“It’s not something you can say you’ve enjoyed, but it was a tremendous
experience. A lot of people say that it’s changed me. When you’ve worked
like that for six weeks - just six weeks - and you see what people have
had to put up with for 17 years, it just kind of calms you down.”</p>
