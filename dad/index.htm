<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Ramsay
George Small was born on the 5</font><font size="3"><sup>th </sup>of
February 1930, in Calcutta, the third of the four children of Robert
and Anne Small. His father a jute mill <i>manager</i> remained in
India with his wife throughout the 1930s, although Ramsay came home at
the tender age of 2, to be looked after by his grandmother, a woman who
was to have a profound influence on his upbringing and values.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was educated at Rosebank School, then Harris Academy, and his academic
ability allowed him to go on to study medicine at Queens College
Dundee, then part of St Andrews University.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">As a
young man, at school and then university, he had also committed himself
to the three other things, which, together with medicine, would make up
the 4 cornerstones of what, no-one can deny, was a fulfilled life: his
Christian faith, his family, and his love of music.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Brought
up in a Christian home, he had become a Christian himself, and was
baptised in Rattray Street Baptist Church in 1945. He would go on to
become church organist and choirmaster there. Through his involvement
with the vibrant young evangelical community in Dundee at the time, he
met, and later fell for Aileen Masterton. They married in 1952, when
Ramsay was still a student, and set up home together.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">In
1954, he graduated and began work, at Stracathro Hospital, and
Maryfield Dundee. Ronald was born that year, with Douglas following in
1955. Where they found time for family life when he was working the
sort of hours junior doctors had to work in the 1950s is a mystery to
me, and national service in the RAMC must have come as something of a
relief.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">If
you go to the village museum in Crail, you can find an old black and
white photograph of the foreign language school, mid1950s, and hiding
in the corner is a character who looks suspiciously like Adolf Hitler
on the run. This is my father, providing medical care to would be spies
learning Russian in the East Neuk of Fife.<br>

</font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><img src="crailnct.jpg" border="0" height="218" width="358"></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">By
1958, Kenneth had arrived, and the family moved to Ayrshire, as by then
Ramsay had completed his Diploma in Public Health and decided to pursue
a career in that specialty. He returned to Dundee in 1961, now with
four boys, to take up the post under the Medical Officer of Health of
the city, Ian Weir, eventually becoming a principal medical officer
there, a position he held until 1974.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><font face="Verdana Ref" size="3"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">1961 also saw the beginning of his
42 year relationship with 46 Monifieth Road, and with Broughty Ferry
Baptist Church.</span>&nbsp;</font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><font face="Verdana Ref" size="3"><br>
<img src="http://www.broughtybaptist.org/Graphics/baptist_old.JPG" border="0" height="297" width="399"></font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><font face="Verdana Ref" size="3"><br>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> At the time a tiny fellowship,
struggling to survive, my mother tells of an evening when my father
turned up for a midweek prayer meeting to find only he and Wyn Christie
there. Downhearted, and close to giving up, my father listened to Wyn&apos;s
earnest prayers for the growth of the church, and they carried on. I
think they agreed not to close the meeting with a hymn that evening.</span></font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" align="left"><font size="4"><font size="3">I remember Sunday evenings, the four of us dressed in our
kilts, when the Small family made up half the congregation. Fortified
with fruit gums from Betty Kinloch, we would sit under the watching
eyes of our parents. I well remember Douglas&apos;
s disgust at being denied
the chance to watch the 1970 World Cup final, because it was on a
Sunday evening and we had to go to church.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">His
faithfulness in the small things of the Christian life were always as
important to him as were the grander schemes of church life. He was a
good listener, a comforter, a man of wise council, as well as a
preacher and teacher of the word of God.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">By
the 1970s, Ramsay had become involved with the Baptist Union of
Scotland at a national level, and became its President in 1972. By then
he was also Secretary in Broughty Ferry, and was preparing for a change
of direction in his career, brought on by health service
re-organisaiton in 1974. That Presidential year, I was too wee to be
left at home, and my mother and I must have heard him preach sermons in
about 20 churches throughout the length and breadth of Scotland. It
must have been tempting just to use the same one every week; not my
father. And still he found time to preach in Broughty Ferry every
month, write the magazine, take his turn on the organ rota, and take us
to exotic, far away places for our holidays. Strontian, Wester Ross,
Skye, Inverary rain and midgies.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Around
about this time, and younger than I am now, he was to make acquaintance
with an adversary which was to become the thorn in his flesh for the
rest of his days, and for which only God&apos;
s grace was sufficient
comfort. My father suffered from ischaemic heart disease for almost 40
years, and as a family we lived under the shadow of its impending
danger, my mother more than any, only now brought to fruition in his
death last week.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">In
1974, he moved out of the old Local Authority Public Health system, and
became a Community Medicine Specialist, with responsibility for
infectious diseases,.. and found his professional home. In what seems
now a second renaissance of public health, he was able to build links
across Tayside in Infection Control, making contact within Local
Authorities, General Practice, Laboratories and Secondary Care, he had
a network of Flu spotter practices, contacts with both sections of the
Constitution Street clinic the chest bit and the other bit, and (for
me), most memorably, a close working relationship with the late Bill
Jamieson &amp; Chris Pennington, and of course Dr Mary Kerr at the
infection unit of Kings Cross. He also became involved at a National
Level in disease prevention, through the Joint Committee for
Vaccination and Immunisation, and the Scottish Infection Control Unit.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
often used to delight listeners by reminding them that throughout his
professional life, diarrhoea was his bread and butter.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Never
too professionally dignified or blinkered to recognise the human need
behind the medical challenge, he came into his own in the mid 1980s,
when HTLv3, (subsequently HIV) testing revealed an exponential rise in
notified cases in the drug injecting community of Dundee. My father
visited hundreds of people himself, contact tracing, counselling,
giving out the news of a positive result. During that time, he was, as
he always had been, following his Lord and Master into the places most
of us would rather avoid.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Academically,
of course, by then he had become a member, then fellow of the faculty
of Community Medicine and an academic tutor, and had, under the
encouragement of his friend and mentor, Alec Mair, become an Honourary
Senior Lecturer in the Department of Community Medicine, the University
of Dundee. He was also a visiting Lecturer at what we used to call the
Bell Street Tech, now Abertay University.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">And
still he preached at Broughty Baptist Church, at least once a month,
took his turn on the organ rota, wrote the magazine, was church
secretary, and the Angus and Perthshire Baptist Association secretary,
Christian Medical Fellowship member and still found time to sing
with and later chair Network, many of whose members are here today.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">In
1985 he made his final career move, when he took over from his friend
and colleague Ronnie Graham as Chief Administrative Medical Officer for
Tayside.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">This
job required tact and diplomacy, a deft touch when dealing with tricky
situations and prickly senior colleagues, an ability to deal with
politicians and press with subtlety and grace. Who on earth was on that
interview panel, they obviously didn&apos;
t know my father.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">As a
family, we celebrate the dubious tribute given to him, face to face, by
a now long gone neighbour. After a typical loss of patience involving a
half hour wait on double yellow lines and a gossipy delay, my father
did what my kids would describe as ‘a Basil Fawlty’. Ignoring the lady,
he berated my mother and I before encouraging us to get a move on
before he got a ticket.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">A
couple of weeks later, the neighbour made a bee line for dad at the
church door one Sunday morning..</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">&apos;
Ramsay,
I just want to tell you that you are the rudest man I have ever met - 

but then, what can you expect from a Baptist.&apos;
</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Well
what could you expect from this Baptist&apos;
. I&apos;
ll tell you what. Continued
wisdom gleaned from the word of God, particularly the old testament
prophets, preached from the pulpit round the corner, and given out in
quiet moments and strict confidence to any who sought it.
Professionally, he had become an honorary Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians in Edinburgh,&apos;
 an exam he could never have hoped to pass
himself&apos;
. Nor me for that matter&apos;
 but was soon to turn his efforts
towards service of different kinds. Ill health was catching up, and
eventually forced his retirement in 1989.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">In
the last 14 years, which I hesitate to describe as his retirement, he
has developed music groups within the church, pursued his love of organ
music through the local Tayside Organists society, and become actively
involved in the National Trust for Scotland, as its local members group
secretary and chairman. There will be people here today who know him
through the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, Abertay Historical
Society, the Dundee Archivists, the Atholl Baptist Centre, and the
Order of St John of Jerusalem, of which he became an officer last year.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" align="center"><font size="4"><img src="cross_b85.gif" border="0" height="85" width="85"></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">This
is a man who would tell his sons that they needed to slow down..ah yes
dad, do what I say, not as I do!</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">So
much for the curriculum vitae, but what of the man? In ah the years
I&apos;
ve kent my faither, I&apos;
ve found him to be a man of many contrasts, you
might even say paradoxes.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was a man who didn&apos;
t tolerate fools gladly, if indeed at all, but yet
had endless patience for the disadvantaged and helpless.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">A
man of scrupulous integrity, frustratingly honest, with principles
which he stuck to even when they cost him, and yet he could sit without
prejudice with those whose lifestyles would horrify most of us.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was a man who held dear to Baptist principles, who, none the less
worked tirelessly for many years for an ecumenical church community in
Broughty Ferry.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was a man who was devoted to, and respected his wife through the 52
years of their marriage, yet who called her a stupid woman on an
alarmingly regular basis.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was a man who was tremendously proud of his children&apos;
s achievements,
who would, nonetheless, take a good book along to a school prize giving
or graduation.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was, without doubt or argument, the worst driver I, or any of my
brothers has ever seen, yet he last bashed his car in 1955.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was a man who was comfortable in the presence of royalty and
politicians, the great and the good of the medical elite, who never
allowed himself, or his sons to forget that we were all Jock Tamson&apos;
s
bairns.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
was a man who had a special device which allowed him to use even the
tiniest stub of a pencil, who always recycled envelopes, and yet who
would give you the last tenner from his wallet,if mum had given him
one.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">When
I sat down to write this, I was conscious of how difficult it would be
to get the balance right, when talking of a man who tried to do so much
with his life, and who achieved so much. Earlier, I mentioned the four
cornerstones upon which he had built his life.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">Throughout
all the stages of his life, he loved his home, his family.. of all
generations, even when they drove him nuts, and they often did.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
loved his work, whether paid or voluntary, ..I get the feeling that he
tried to make a difference, with the ability that God had given him,
and I know that he did, and many here can give greater testament to
that than I can.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">But
above all, he was a man of Faith, who served his saviour through his
music, his preaching, through broadcasting and writing, and through
sitting quietly with a troubled soul, helping the Lord to have his way.
It is for this, above all else, that we celebrate his life today.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
loved the minor prophets of the Old Testament, and it was through
listening to him preach that I discovered the verse in Micah that has
helped me to remember what life is really all about. I know it was one
of his favourites, and I think it fits him well.</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">He
has showed you O man, what is good,</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">And
what does the Lord require of you</font></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="4"><font size="3">To
act Justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.</font></font></p>
