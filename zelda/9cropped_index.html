He is calleafter Ozymandias - out of a famous peome by Shelley
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
I met a traveller from an antique land,<BR>
Who said - Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<BR>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<BR>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<BR>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<BR>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<BR>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<BR>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<BR>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<BR>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<BR>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<BR>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<BR>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<BR>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
