      This is the main flex container that holds everything.
      It uses `flex-row` to arrange the main sections side-by-side.
      `justify-center` centers the content horizontally.
      `items-stretch` is the key here; it makes the columns stretch to the same height.

          It's a nested flex container with `flex-col` (flex-direction: column).
