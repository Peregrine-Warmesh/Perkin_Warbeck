        There are many paradoxes contained within the Christian faith. At the
        heart of faith in God itself is this one - that on the one hand God can
        be seen and known, and on the other hand God is mystery and hidden. (see
        Isaiah 45:15)<br>
        This Old Testament paradox - that God can be known and God is hidden -
        provided the starting point for a book by Robert Davidson (The Courage
        to Doubt (1983)) exploring this theme.<br>
        Davidson demonstrated that doubts, questions, anger, and even rebellion
        found a valid place within the Bible, and that in worship there was an
        honesty perhaps lacking in churches today.<br>
        For example, the Psalms are songs of worship resounding with all kinds
        of human emotions - they are hymns of praise and adoration and
        thankfulness, but they are also vehicles for expressing doubt,
        disappointment, anger and questioning God's provision and fairness in a
        world where often the innocent suffer and the wicked prosper.<br>
        The worshipping community of Israel found a place for expressing their
        real feelings to God, including their questions and doubts. They were
        able to see that faith and doubt lived together, and that this paradox
        was an essential part of their believing.<br>
        One of the striking things about the psalms is how the psalmist can move
        from praise to doubt (and even back again), within a few verses of the
        same psalm.<br>
        A good example of this kind of tension is Psalm 74.<br>
        God's greatness is proclaimed:<br>
        <i>"You created the day and the night; you set the sun and the moon in
          their places; you set the limits of the earth; you made summer and
          winter."</i> (vs.16,17)<br>
        God's power to intervene and support is also acknowledged:<br>
        <i>"You have been our king from the beginning, O God; you have saved us
          many times. With your mighty strength you divided the sea.."
          (vs.12,13)<br>
        </i>Yet at the same time, the present reality seems to point to a God
        who has forgotten his people and chosen to ignore their plight, and this
        too is expressed in the hymn:<br>
        <i>"Why have you abandoned us like this, O God ?.. Why have you refused
          to help us ?.. Rouse yourself, God !.."</i> (vs.1,11,22)<br>
        <i><br>
          "It is important to grasp the tensions within this psalm: the tension
          between what the past affirms to be true and what the present seems to
          deny; the tension between believing that the key to God's nature is to
          be found in the idea of love and facing a situation in which there are
          no evident signs of such love.<br>
          If you have been brought up to affirm that God is a powerful, active,
          living God and live through an experience which seems to speak only of
          the triumph of ruthless and arrogant evil, how do you explain it ? Is
          God asleep ?"<br>
        </i>(Robert Davidson: The Courage to Doubt p8)<br>
        <br>
        Doubts and questions affect us in different ways and in different times.
        What may greatly trouble one person will cause another to lose little
        sleep, and vice versa. Some people seem to be more pre-disposed towards
        doubting than others.<br>
        However, what also is clear, is that doubting is part of the landscape
        of faith, and that there are times when we all have to face up to
        questions, and worries, and we wonder whether God is there, and if so,
        does this God actually care about us ?<br>
        One minister, who survived a shooting incident, when the gunman firing
        on him missed at point blank range, was encouraged by his friends. <br>
        <i>"Your guardian angel was looking after you." "God was protecting
          you."</i> <br>
        Being a man of faith, he was happy to agree with these versions of
        events.<br>
        Then he remembered a minister colleague and his wife, murdered recently
        in their homes by intruders. Where were their guardian angels on that
        night ? Where was God's protection for them ?<br>
        (see Dunn: Don't Just Stand There)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;There are different sources of doubts, and they may affect us in
        different times and in different ways. Here are a few.<br>
        <br>
        <b>a) INTELLECTUAL PROBLEMS WITH CHRISTIAN TEACHING.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;</b>Examples of this would include addressing the
        trustworthiness of the Bible, or situations where church teaching is in
        conflict with an individual's own moral stance, or tackling an issue of
        doctrine.<br>
        (It seems that most books written on "doubt" seem to deal particularly
        with this kind of thing with a heavy emphasis on correct teaching or
        doctrine)<br>
        <br>
        <b>b) A SENSE OF THE "ABSENCE" OF GOD</b>.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;God may appear unreal or distant. Many people have written about
        this, from the psalmist, King David, St John of the Cross, Martin Luther
        and more recently, Martin Buber.<br>
        <em>"The Bible knows of God's hiding his face, of times when the contact
          between heaven and earth semes to be interrupted. God seems to
          withdraw himself utterly from the earth and no longer to participate
          in its existence. The space of history is then full of noise, but as
          it were, empty of divine breath. For one who believes in the living
          God, who knows about him, and is fated to spend his life in a time of
          his hiddenness, it is very difficult to live."<br>
        </em>(Martin Buber: The Dialogue between Heaven and Earth)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>c) RESPONDING TO TRAGEDY IN OUR LIVES OR IN THE LIVES OF
          OTHERS.</strong><br>
        A major trigger of doubt for Christians is the presence of tragedy. That
        the world should contain so much suffering when we believe in a loving,
        all-powerful God remains a mystery, and for some a real stumbling block
        to faith.<br>
        But even if we can accept (in an academic sense) this dilemma, when
        tragedy strikes at our own door, or at the door of someone we love, the
        problem presents itself in a much more forceful way.<br>
        <br>
        One of the most influential Christian writers of our century, C.S.
        Lewis, discovered at the time of his wife's death, that God seemed
        completely absent.<br>
        And in this time of pain he wrote these words:<br>
        <em><br>
          "Meanwhile, where is God? This is one of the most disquieting
          symptoms. When you are happy, so happy that you have no sense of
          needing Him, so happy that you are tempted to feel His claims upon you
          as an interruption, if you remember yourself and turn to Him with
          gratitude and praise, you will be - or so it feels -welcomed with open
          arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help
          is vain, and what do you find?<br>
          <br>
          A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting
          on the inside. After that, silence. You may as well turn away. The
          longer you wait the more emphatic the silence will become. There are
          no lights in the windows. It might be an empty house. Was it ever
          inhabited? It seemed so once. And that seeming was as strong as this.
          What can this mean? Why is He so present a commander in our time of
          prosperity and so very absent a help in time of trouble?"<br>
        </em><br>
        (C.S. Lewis: A Grief Observed)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>d) FACING UP TO OUR OWN IMMORTALITY<br>
        </strong>There are situations we can encounter where we take on thoughts
        about ultimate value - we are addressing the meaning of life.<br>
        If we are honest, most of our busyness in day to day living helps us to
        conveniently avoid the searching questions about purpose.<br>
        Many people would claim to be uninterested in questions like:<br>
        "Is there a God ? Does life have meaning ? Is there a purpose to
        humankind's existence ?"<br>
        Such questions would be the domain of philisophical or religious
        "types".<br>
        Yet no one can go through life without at some time asking themselves
        the question "Does MY life have purpose ? Does MY life have value ?"<br>
        James Fowler, a professor at Candler School of Theology, spoke of how he
        once woke up in the middle of the night thinking about his death. What
        would his death mean ? And, in the end, what would his life have meant ?<br>
        <em><br>
          "During these moments I was not in my faith. I seemed to stand
          completely naked - a soul without body, raiment or roles. A soul alone
          with what ? With whom ?<br>
          <br>
          Faith is a coat against this nakedness. For most of us, most of the
          time, faith functions so as to screen off the abyss of mystery that
          surrounds us. But we all at certain times, call upon faith to provide
          nerve to stand in the presence of the abyss - naked, stripped of life
          supports, trusting only in the the being, the mercy, and the power of
          the Other in the darkness."<br>
        </em><br>
        (James Fowler: Stages of Faith pxii)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <strong>ADDITIONAL WORRY</strong><br>
        Faith and doubt stand together, as two sides of the same fence, and the
        living of our spiritual lives involves the acceptance of this tension.<br>
        The "down-side" of doubt, obviously, is that it makes us feel insecure,
        and makes us question the reality or the validity of what our faith
        would profess. For the person of faith, doubt is not usually welcome.
        Given a free vote, we would want to get rid of doubt altogether. It is
        much more comfortable to stand on the "faith" side of the fence.<br>
        But what if (at any moment of time), we cannot do that ?<br>
        What if our doubts are real ?<br>
        Suppressing questions and doubts will not make them go away.<br>
        One thing we do not need, is to add to our troubles the additional worry
        that there is something defective in us - as if we are in some ways
        inferior Christians.<br>
        A disturbing trend in our modern church is to see individual doubts as
        indicative of defective reasoning or immaturity or intellectual
        weakness.<br>
        Doubts are often portrayed as a problem to be solved, an obstacle to be
        removed, a sign of immaturity, or a symptom of weak faith.<br>
        <br>
        Os Guinness includes the following categories as "families" of doubt - a
        faulty view of God, lack of growth, lack of commitment, ingratitude, and
        weak foundations.<br>
        (see Os Guinness: Doubt - Faith in Two Minds)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Alister McGrath tends to follow the same line, suggesting that we
        could do better:<br>
        "Doubt is a sign that we've neglected our relationship with God."<br>
        (Alister McGrath: Doubt p112)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;"It is helpful to think of doubt as a symptom of human frailty, of
        our reluctance to trust God."<br>
        (McGrath p10)<br>
        <br>
        Words like these suggest that doubts are something that are our own
        fault - almost something to be ashamed of.<br>
        McGrath explores the difference beween justification (being put right
        with God as a result of faith) and sanctification (the gradual change in
        character and thinking which emerges over time) to show that doubts are
        symbolic of being between the two stages - symbolic of an immature faith
        which has not had time to develop.<br>
        There will be cases where this is true. Doubts may be caused by
        insufficient understanding of faith, and doubts may be caused by our
        unwillingness to explore faith adequately, but is this really the whole
        story ?<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Is it not the case that doubts may arise in someone who has a very
        clear understanding of faith, or indeed in someone who has found that
        her very willingness to truly explore her beliefs have resulted in her
        doubts ?!<br>
        <br>
        It is unfair to think, (as some Christians seem to do), that doubting is
        a byproduct of sitting lightly to faith. As if those who doubt,
        invariably do so casually. In this scenario, doubting appears like some
        kind of intellectual game played out in a pub discussion about what
        Christianity is all about, or whether the church has had its day. Often
        in these kinds of discussions the stakes are not high and the
        protagonists enjoy a good argument.<br>
        <br>
        For some people doubt is much more of a real problem. It's not
        necessarily so much about the historicity of Christianity or wondering
        about the empty Easter tomb - it's trying to square what you have
        already believed with life's experiences now. This tension, as evidenced
        in the quotations above from Psalm 74, is all too painful for some
        Christians today.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;There is such a thing as honest doubting, and while that may not
        be a comfortable place to be, it is sad that many people are also having
        to struggle with an "unneccesarily guilty conscience." (Robert Davidson:
        The Courage to Doubt pxi)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;In a book of his sermons, Frederick Beuchner said:<br>
        <em>"Love must be freely given. Love must live in the freedom not to
          love; it must take risks. Love must be prepared to suffer even as
          Jesus on the Cross suffered and part of that suffering is doubt, even
          as Jesus on the Cross doubted."<br>
        </em>(Frederick Beuchner: The Magnificent Defeat p88f)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>DISPOSING OF DOUBT ?</strong><br>
        Perhaps doubts should be thought of in much the same way as other
        maladies. A headache can be cured in an hour after taking a pill,
        pneumonia may last a couple of months, and a weak back may be a
        permanent feature. Not all doubts will come and go in the same way. Not
        all can be displaced with the same remedy.<br>
        <br>
        Some doubts can be disposed of very quickly through a better grasp of
        what faith is about, or by laying to rest a misconception - in other
        words, a simple matter of reading the right book or speaking to a
        responsible Christian who is able to "put you right". This is obviously
        true where doubt is a matter of a lack of knowledge or understanding.<br>
        <br>
        But other doubts can take a passage of time to work through - it would
        be insensitive in the extreme to suggest that someone who has been
        recently bereaved should be able to dispense with fears, doubts and
        questions at the drop of a hat.<br>
        <br>
        Still other doubts may have to be accepted and lived with on a long-term
        basis - such is the paradox of faith.<br>
        <br>
        Kelly James Clark, associate professor of philosophy at Calvin College
        in Michigan, wrote about the Christian self-help books which seem to
        promise a ten step plan which will put your life on course and solve any
        problem:<br>
        <em>"The manuals treat doubt as one would a headache, a broken arm, or
          athlete's foot. Simply following the doctor's orders, applying the
          quick remedy, or popping a pill will relieve both symptoms and malady.
          But doubt is really more like athritis, nearsightedness, and the
          common cold. These are not neccesarily terminal ailments, but they are
          not easily curable either. Some of their symptoms can be masked for a
          while, but sooner rather than later they will manifest themselves,
          sometimes quite powerfully. These are ailments we must simply learn to
          live with, even though learning to live with them is not something we
          desire or welcome. So too with doubt: it is a malady that we shouldn't
          relish or glorify, but we must make do with it."<br>
        </em>(Kelly Clark: When Faith Is Not Enough p96)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;The story of Job in the Old Testament is a classic treatment of
        faith and doubt. In the light of extreme adversity, Job has to make
        sense of his faith in a just and loving God. Why has such calamity
        fallen on him ? What has he done to deserve this ?<br>
        In one way, Job is disappointing, for at the end of the book the reader
        is yet to discover a neat rational answer to the problem. Yet there are
        important lessons to be learned from the book.<br>
        <strong>Firstly,</strong> Job's friends (who take the traditional line
        on God and suffering), are discredited.<br>
        They tell Job that this suffering is God teaching him a lesson (see
        5:17), the result of sin in his life (see 4:7), and that God will give
        him good fortune as soon as he mends his ways (see 8:3-6)<br>
        The final "friend", a man called Elihu, takes a different line. He is
        not ready to agree with the others on this. But he condemns Job's
        questioning of God as itself a sin. Job asks too many questions,
        according to Elihu. (see 35:16)<br>
        But God is not happy with any of these thoughts. The simplistic views
        that there is no mystery to suffering are not good enough. It is NOT the
        case that suffering is a "deserved punishment" for sin. It is NOT the
        case that Job is sinning by bringing his concerns to God.<br>
        <em>"You did not speak the truth to me, as my servant Job did."</em><br>
        (42:7)<br>
        It's worth recalling the words of Christ, confronted by a blind man, in
        John Chapter 9. The disciples ask Jesus whether the sin of the man or
        the parents of the man are to blame for the man's blindness.<br>
        Jesus replies "Neither" (v3) Disability isn't a punishment for sin sent
        from God.<br>
        On another occasion, Jesus refers to a local disaster at Siloam to make
        the same point. The people killed when the tower fell were no worse than
        anyone else. Misfortunes and disasters are not punishments sent by God.
        (see Luke 13:4)<br>
        Life can go wrong for us. But that is not a sign of God's punishment.<strong><br>
          Secondly</strong>, Job does not find that God grants him an answer to
        his problem, but he discovers that God is with him in his pain and is
        able to give him hope for the future.<br>
        God confronts Job with the complexity of creation, and Job's inability
        to understand all things. God's ways are more complicated than human
        ways. The roots of life (and suffering) are entwined in vast and complex
        relationships which we mortals could never fully grasp.<br>
        In addition, God grants to Job the knowledge that his love and care
        continues to surround him and will sustain him, as well as the
        reassurance that misfortune is NOT some punishment sent from on high.<br>
        As a result, Job is able to have grounds for continuing to believe and
        trust in God.<br>
        <strong>Thirdly,</strong> and perhaps most importantly, Job discovers
        that this so-called impious questioning and confrontation with God is
        not out of place but perfectly reasonable and even neccesary.<br>
        It is only after thinking and debating and wrestling with the issues and
        "taking God on", that Job is able to make his decision to continue in
        faith.<br>
        It is only by refusing to lie down to the simplistic explanations of
        others and instead by being brave enough to confront the feelings of
        doubts and confusion that he feels that he is able to overcome them and
        move on to a deeper faith.<br>
        God is big enough to respond to Job's expressions of doubts and
        confusion. And Job is justified in presenting this side of himself to
        God.<br>
        <br>
        <em>"Withholding lament betrays a lack of fidelity. When we express our
          anguish to God, we draw God into our experience. To avoid God
          stoically in times of suffering or to maintain piously that "all is
          well" when we know good and well that it isn't - this prevents God
          from fully entering into our believing experience. The life of
          authentic faith demands raging at God when we want to know "Why"?<br>
          <br>
          Job is offered not only God's message, but also God himself. Part of
          the message of Job is that we needn't suffer impassively. We can even
          thrust our anger upon God. Our hope is that, as for Job, God will meet
          us with his grace. Many Christians think it is inappropriate to
          express their anger and frustrations to God.....We think we honour God
          with our false praise, but we don't. God is big enough and cares
          enough to bear our anger. God graciously meets the blasphemer with a
          vision of his power and goodness. And when we, like Job, receive this
          healing balm, we no longer need to find completely rational answers."<br>
        </em>(Kelly Clark: When Faith Is Not Enough p89)<br>
        <br>
        At the outset, we need to accept three things:<br>
        Firstly, that there are times when God will seem absent, unreal or
        distant.<br>
        Secondly, that honesty may compel us to doubt or ask searching questions
        of our faith, and that asking these questions is okay.<br>
        And thirdly, that doubts and questions may be a neccesary stage for us
        on the road to spiritual maturity.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>2) SPIRITUAL STAGES</strong><br>
        A woman called Alice came to see me with regard to joining the church.
        She was middle-aged, and belonged originally to England. She had joined
        a church down there but that was many years ago and she felt it would be
        neccesary to rejoin. At this point Alice had been coming quite regularly
        to services in the church.<br>
        She was aware of the vows of membership for the Church of Scotland, but
        she had a minor problem with one of them - such a minor problem that I
        cannot now remember what it was !<br>
        She was not sure that she believed something in quite the way she felt
        she would be expected to believe and this was causing her some distress.
        In fact she was quite tearful about it. She felt certain she wanted to
        join the church but she knew she had to be honest about what she truly
        believed and truly doubted.<br>
        In the end, after some discussion, everything was sorted out and she
        felt able to join the congregation, which she did.<br>
        What I do remember about that situation was my reaction to her visit
        after she had gone. "Thank God for that woman !" I thought to myself.
        "Thank God for this person who cares so much and takes her faith so
        seriously that she would worry so much about it!"<br>
        Most people who join the church do so at a relatively young age after a
        period of instruction and information as to what is involved. At one
        time, when church membership was higher, this was almost one rite of
        passage into adulthood for young people in Christian homes.<br>
        Even now, joining the church through profession of faith, seems
        relatively easy to those who come forward for membership.<br>
        Alice was making heavy weather of it. She was a person who was aware of
        her doubts. And yet I sensed in her a maturity, and a seriousness about
        her faith that has since been borne out.<br>
        <br>
        (Incidentally, when personal tragedy struck at my own door, a little
        later on, Alice was one of the few church members to write personally to
        me, and of those who did, every single one had themselves been through
        very difficult circumstances in their own lives).<br>
        The point here is that a mature faith is not necessarily a faith that is
        exempt from doubts.<br>
        <br>
        In fact, doubts themselves may be a sign of maturity. For doubts can
        come from asking questions and not being afraid to take faith seriously.
        For many people, their reluctance to ask questions is a sign of the
        superficiality of their faith.<br>
        <br>
        We have a implicit tendency in the church to applaud anyone who does not
        suffer from doubt. "Their faith is strong," we reason.<br>
        That just might be true. But there is another possibility. Maybe their
        faith is just not important enough, or being taken seriously enough, to
        reach a stage where doubts may surface.<br>
        In the same way, there is the tendency to suggest that a person who does
        suffer from doubts is unspiritual, or neglecting their faith, when in
        fact, the exact opposite may be true.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;It may come as a surprise to many pastors and church leaders to
        think of the questioning or doubting members of their congregation as
        showing signs of spiritual maturity. Usually such people are criticised
        or pitied, rather than thought of in a positive light. It may come as a
        surprise to many that there are such things as "spiritual stages" at
        all.<br>
        Someone once said that growth is the only proof of life. Growth and
        development are true of every area of our lives. This includes our
        spirituality. At any time, our spiritual stage will determine how we
        respond to faith and how we regard the people around us within the faith
        community. Our spiritual stage will influence our attitudes and
        behaviour.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>SPIRITUAL STAGES</strong><br>
        Most of the recent thinking on the idea of "stages" derives from the
        work of Professor James Fowler of Candler School of Theology in Atlanta.<br>
        (see Stages of Faith, Faith Develpoment and Pastoral Care etc)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Fowler suggests six categories of faith to which he gives his own
        descriptive titles.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;1) Chaotic faith<br>
        <br>
        2) Ordering faith<br>
        <br>
        3) Conforming faith<br>
        <br>
        4) Choosing/Either-or faith<br>
        <br>
        5) Balanced/Inclusive faith<br>
        <br>
        6) Selfless faith<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Subtleties abound in this classification:<br>
        People can be moving between stages at vastly different times of life -
        some never progress beyond certain stages, and very few reach what
        Fowler would classify as stage 6. The differences between the
        classifications themselves can be slight, and more recently others have
        tried to simplify the categories while acknowledging their debt to
        Fowler's work.<br>
        For example, John Westerhoff speaks of four distinctive styles of faith.
        These can be correlated to Fowler's stages.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;1) Experienced faith<br>
        <br>
        2) Affiliative faith<br>
        <br>
        3) Searching faith<br>
        <br>
        4) Owned faith<br>
        <br>
        (see "Will Our Children Have Faith ?" pp90)<br>
        <br>
        The most straightforward of simplications has been suggested by M. Scott
        Peck in different writings, in particular "The Different Drum".<br>
        Peck suggests four categories. These redefined stages retain the basic
        thrust of Fowler's own.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;1) Chaotic, antisocial<br>
        <br>
        2) Formal, institutional<br>
        <br>
        3) Sceptic, individual<br>
        <br>
        4) Mystic, communal<br>
        <br>
        (see "The Different Drum" pp187-200)<br>
        <br>
        Stage 1 represents an undeveloped spirituality, common to children and
        some adults. <br>
        Stage 2 represents perhaps the majority of churchgoers, where the
        emphasis is on the "form" rather than the "essence" of religion.<br>
        Stage 3 represents many non-believers, yet the kind of person within
        this group is most likely to be more spiritually "developed" than those
        in Stage 2.<br>
        Stage 4 represents the working through of questions and doubts of Stage
        3 to a really owned and mature faith.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Obviously these stages have implications for the church community
        in its dealings with (and understanding of) those non-believers with
        whom there is no present connection.<br>
        However, the crunch for the church internally, seems to be how to deal
        with believers moving from Stage 2 into Stage 3.<br>
        How can they be held within the household of faith?<br>
        Are we big enough to include the questions and the questioners?<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>SPHERES OF CONFLICT</strong><br>
        The existence of different stages of faith result in two potential
        spheres of conflict.<br>
        * There is an issue for the church itself to face up to.<br>
        How can the church satisfy the different needs of its members, and
        particularly keep a grasp of those who find themselves on the borders of
        its fellowship ?<br>
        * There is an issue for individuals here too. The transition from one
        spiritual stage to another is not often smooth. God may be behind it
        all, but it doesn't seem like God !<br>
        <br>
        <strong>CONFLICT WITHIN THE CHURCH.........</strong><br>
        "Evidence suggests that the majority of adults in our society arrest or
        equilibrate in the Ordering or Conforming Stage."<br>
        (Fowler: "Weaving the New Creation" p21)<br>
        "The difficulty is that (Stage 2) people do not see the possibility of
        anything different from their own position being valid."<br>
        ("How Faith Grows" p68)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;These quotes illustrate a big problem for the churches. Sticking
        with Peck's classifications, we could say that the great majority of
        church-going people would be best described as Stage Two people. For
        these people, (and these people would include some ministers and church
        leaders) the "form" rather than the "essence" of religion is most
        important.<br>
        <br>
        (This goes some way to explaining the reluctance of so many church
        people to "change" within the liturgy or practice of their own church or
        denomination.)<br>
        <br>
        Their strengths would include, trust, faithfulness and dedication to the
        church, and many people in this category would prove to be loyal,
        hardworking, members of their local congregation, contributing much of
        themselves into the wider life of the fellowship.<br>
        <br>
        The weaknesses here would include a view of "change" within the
        structure of the denomination (or in worship) to be invariably a
        negative influence to be resisted, and an inability to accommodate the
        views of other Christians, especially those who are particularly
        sceptical or questioning.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;As a result, the most comfortable position to be in as a current
        church member is to be quietly accepting of faith rather than asking
        questions of it. And for people moving in to a time when they feel that
        questions have to be asked and faith has to be explored, it can seem as
        if they are on the outskirts of the faith community or even outside it.
        As a result, there are many people who feel they have to leave the
        church (and who do), because either they have moved away from God, or
        the people in the fellowship imply there is something wrong with them.<br>
        <br>
        The challenge for the church is to allow for openness and exploration.
        The feeling that we must "keep a lid" on questions and doubts leads to a
        double problem. On the one hand, there is a sense of exclusion for those
        who feel unable to suppress their questions or doubts, and on the other
        hand, pressure on everyone else in the faith community not to own up to
        their own questions or admit to doubts.<br>
        <br>
        The refusal to face up to doubt, does not take doubt away. It rather
        prevents us from moving into maturity in our faith.<br>
        <br>
        The dangers have been outlined on different occasions by two Christian
        psychiatrists, anxious to maintain that spiritual health involves the
        existence of doubts within faith:<br>
        <br>
        <em>"For the most part the churches have not yet learned that the best
          way to pass from defensive rationalisations to secure faith is to let
          doubts, inconsistencies, confusions and rebellions come out into the
          open instead of using various forms of spiritual coertion to keep them
          hidden or to draw them from awareness altogether."<br>
        </em>(D.E. Roberts, quoted by Davidson p17)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Scott Peck bemoans the church's <em>"discouragement, through the
          ages, of doubt. In so doing it has consistently driven growing people
          out of its potential community, often fixating them thereby in a
          perpetual resistance to spiritual insights. Conversely, the church is
          not going to meet this challenge until doubt is properly considered a
          Christian virtue - indeed a Christian responsibility. We neither can
          nor should skip over questioning in our development."</em><br>
        <br>
        (M. Scott Peck: "The Different Drum" p200)<br>
        <br>
        Security in faith does not come through ignoring or bypassing doubts but
        accepting them and dealing with the reality of them. In the end, our
        doubts may then be put behind us, or we may come to the understanding
        that our doubts are there with us as companions on life's journey.
        Either way, we will be the stronger by having the courage to confront
        what honesty compels us to address in our own lives.<br>
        <br>
        In an age when the church feels itself to be on the defensive, and
        having to stand up to a world where so many people feel there is no role
        for the church, it can appear natural to assume that Christians must
        draw firm positions on matters of faith, and demonstrate a "fixed"
        position on issues of doctrine, morals and biblical interpretation. And
        it is easy to see why, in such a climate, that doubters and questioners
        within the church are seen as hampering this work, and diluting the
        faith which is so threatened.<br>
        <br>
        Yet it is this very inflexibility, and inability of churches to accept
        different standpoints, and to allow for stages of growth, which is
        hampering the work of the Kingdom, and implicitly (if not explicitly)
        excluding many unnecessarily, from the faith community.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;The church must learn this: that it is alright for people to ask
        questions of their faith.<br>
        <em><br>
          "Some churches and ministers have abandoned theological defensiveness.
          They allow people to bring their questions into the sanctuary without
          insisting on the acceptance of pre-packed answers. They recognise that
          the processes of doubt and anger are part of the mystery of the
          spiritual life and have to be included in God. Christians on the
          theological edge, if they are wise, will not be in a hurry to find
          answers, anyway. They are usually people who have learned that it is
          alright to ask questions. Indeed, they have come to understand that
          faith is a way of living with questions, without being afraid."<br>
        </em>(Richard Holloway: Dancing on the Edge pxiii)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>* CONFLICT WITHIN THE PERSON.........</strong><br>
        The existence of these different spiritual stages, opens up a greater
        understanding of faith for ourselves and others. As we have seen, it
        poses various challenges for the church. In addition, it poses questions
        for us all as individuals. Where are we on our faith journey ?<br>
        Knowing that questions and doubts may be part of the spiritual "stage"
        we are at, may be helpful and reassuring up to a point. But it cannot
        take away the fact that moving into such a stage is painful.<br>
        If it is true to say that questions and doubts can sometimes be seen as
        a move towards maturity and away from superficiality, that does not mean
        that the process is painless. It is often quite the reverse.<br>
        <br>
        <em>"In entering a new Stage there is often the experience of the dark
          night of the soul. There is a time when God is the abyss, the void, or
          the ENEMY. The structure may be unconscious, but the experience of
          that transition is very much conscious and most often painful."<br>
        </em>(Fowler: "Life Maps" p138)<br>
        <br>
        Could it be, that if it is neccessary for us to journey through a
        spiritual time of questioning, resulting in doubting, that God is
        actually behind that process ? If we believe that our spiritual journey
        is guided by God, it would suggest that the stages on the way of that
        journey could be initiated by God too. Scott Peck believes this to be
        the case. Every move between spiritual stages represents, for him, a
        neccesary conversion to a deeper understanding of faith.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;"As part of the process of spiritual growth, the transition from
        Stage 2 to stage 3 is also a conversion. We can be converted to atheism
        or agnosticism or at least, scepticism ! Indeed I have every reason to
        believe that God has a hand in this part of the conversion process as
        well."<br>
        (Peck: The Different Drum p199)<br>
        <br>
        It is hard to find yourself in a place of doubting, perhaps after years
        of feeling that faith was secure from such doubts. An effect of the
        doubts is often to seem to drive a wedge between you and the God that
        once was seen so clearly. To appreciate that the period of doubting
        might be understood as part of God's plan for your spiritual
        development, is to discover a measure of hope and security amidst the
        questions.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>3) GOD OR THE "SYSTEM" ?</strong><br>
        Some years ago I began a hunt for a comic book I had loved as a child.
        It was a story set in the time of the Polish-Cossack wars of the
        seventeenth century - not exactly the best known time of history for me.
        I had never come across the real novel written by Henryk Sienkiewicz,
        ("With Fire and Sword"), but this comic book version I remembered as my
        favourite book for some time. Many of the drawings in it I could picture
        instantly in my head. In fact, I could still remember some of the
        dialogue between characters. Not bad for a book I hadn't seen in 35
        years !<br>
        For some reason, I became anxious to find it again, and to recapture the
        magic of the story. However, tracking this book down was not easy. From
        time to time I would look around second hand comic shops but to no
        avail. One proprietor in Glasgow told me there would be "no problem"
        getting a hold of it, but years later, he still hasn't managed to do so
        !<br>
        Then one day, in holiday in Vancouver, quite by chance, I discovered the
        book.<br>
        It was great to find it, and I am glad to have it, yet I have to admit
        that it was not the wonderful and magical story I imagined (and half
        thought I remembered), it to be.<br>
        My imagination had been fueled by a longing for something, hidden in the
        past or so I believed, but when at last I had it in my possession the
        fact was that the "magic" had gone.<br>
        This experience of longing, fueled by imagination, is common to people
        of all ages. The Christian writer C.S. Lewis was particularly fascinated
        by this subject, believing that the existence of longing was highly
        significant.<br>
        When Lewis addressed these experiences of longing and yearning, he
        suggested that they were themselves pointers to a greater reality
        outside our rational world.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<em>"Most people, if they had really learned to look into their
          own hearts, would know that they do want and want acutely, something
          that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in
          this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep
          their promise. The longing which arises in us when we first fall in
          love, or first think of some foreign country, or first take up some
          subject that excites us, are longings which no marriage, no travel, no
          learning, can really satisfy."</em><br>
        (C.S. Lewis: Mere Christianity p119)<br>
        <br>
        For Lewis, these unfulfilled dreams or longings were not to be disdained
        or rejected but rather cherished and treasured. For they were signs of a
        deeper and greater reality. They were a God-given hunger which could
        never be satisfied in this world and in this life.<br>
        <em>"A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A
          duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel
          sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself
          a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most
          probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of
          my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe
          is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it,
          but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing."<br>
        </em>(C.S. Lewis: Mere Christianity p119f)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Clearly, C.S. Lewis was fascinated by this sense of longing - a
        sense of something beckoning but something which we could never quite
        reach - never quite attain - it was always over the next hill or beyond
        the next bend in the road.<br>
        <em>"The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located
          will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came
          through them, and what came through them was longing.....They are not
          the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not
          found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we
          have never yet visited."<br>
        </em>(C S Lewis: The Weight of Glory p8)<br>
        <br>
        Commenting on these words, Richard Holloway observes that <em>"Lewis
          points to the fundamental truth, which is the provisionality of all
          systems, religious or secular, as well as their symbols and
          instruments. The glory may come through them but is not to be
          identified with them. All sorts of things can mediate meaning, mediate
          the divine, but they are not themselves the meaning, not themselves
          divine."<br>
        </em>(Richard Holloway: Dancing on the Edge p47f)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;We cannot comprehend and worship God without pictures and images
        and symbols and rites. The trouble is that these symbols and pratices
        and traditions and ways of explaining our faith become themselves all
        important. And to question this system appears to be the same as
        questioning God himself.<br>
        But there is an important difference between doubting God himself and
        doubting the "system" built up around God.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>The System ?</strong><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;* Fundamentalism<br>
        <br>
        * The Bible<br>
        <br>
        * Propositional faith<br>
        <br>
        * Cafeteria Christians<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<em>"Christianity invites us to a generous and open-hearted
          commitment to God, though not neccesarily to the words we use to talk
          about God or the systems we develop to respond to God. However, there
          is a tendency in Christianity to load everything with theological
          significance, thereby making reappraisals of traditional attitudes
          unusually difficult."</em><br>
        (Richard Holloway: Dancing on the Edge pxiv)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;The trouble with propositional faith is that it promotes an
        understanding of faith which is "take it or leave it". There is no room
        for discussion or alternative views or debate. Disbelieve the system at
        any one point and you are on the "outside".<br>
        You must take the whole thing or leave the whole thing.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<strong>4) THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH</strong><br>
        (Maturity and Living with Paradox)<br>
        The search for truth is fundamental to life. For Christians this search
        is central and of paramount importance.<br>
        Simone Weil once advised that whenever we had to choose between truth
        and Christ we must choose truth, because Christ is truth before he is
        anything else, and if we choose truth we cannot go far without falling
        into his arms again.<br>
        Looking for truth is a lifelong occupation. Humility is needed in large
        doses. Perhaps it is best to follow Edward de Bono in seeing truth more
        as a direction than a destination.<br>
        <br>
        <em>"How many people actually want to live at the North Pole ? I suspect
          that very few people actually want to live on a sheet of ice in the
          cold. But how many people use "north" as a direction for navigating a
          boat, flying an airliner, hiking through the country, setting
          directions on a map or architect's plan, etc ?<br>
          Obviously "north" is much more useful as a "direction" than as a
          "destination".<br>
          It is somewhat the same with "truth". We want the truth. We try to
          find the truth. We do science to find the truth. Truth is a wonderful
          direction in which to be heading.<br>
          Truth as a "destination" gives us values and certainty. It can also
          give us arrogance and persecution: "I have the truth, therefore
          everyone else must be wrong." "<br>
        </em>(Edward de Bono: Textbook of Wisdom p74)<br>
        <br>
        Faith always lives in tension with doubt.<br>
        The opposite of faith is not doubt - it is certainty !<br>
        For where we have certainty we have no need for faith.<br>
        <br>
        * Maturity - and the principle of multi-determinism.<br>
        <br>
        As modern society moves more and more away from mystery, and as we
        continue to persuade ourselves of our own ability to find answers to all
        questions, there is a tendency to look for simplistic answers to every
        situation.<br>
        <br>
        Complex political situations are rendered straightforward by our media's
        attempts to portray matters in black and white terms with "goodies" and
        "baddies".<br>
        <br>
        Complex arguments on issues as diverse as immigration, homosexuality,
        and abortion are often made to appear straightforward by individuals who
        emphasise one simplistic view at the expense of thinking seriously about
        other points of view.<br>
        <br>
        Maturity means being able to see complexities and avoid pre- packaged
        simplistic answers to life's questions.<br>
        This kind of reflecting and thinking over responses is an indication not
        only of maturity but also of care and concern.<br>
        Caring parents will not instantly jump to decisions when, for example,
        their teenage daughter comes to them with a request, but will want to
        think about what is involved, and reflect on the pros and cons of the
        situation before deciding. Their child may not always be pleased with
        the parental response but she will know that they have taken her request
        seriously and considered it carefully and not simply provided a
        knee-jerk reaction.<br>
        A good example of the need for reflection and avoiding simplistic
        explanations is in our handling of Scripture itself. Christians believe
        that the Bible is the Word of God. But what do we mean by that ?<br>
        <br>
        The Bible presents us with many dilemmas.<br>
        We may dismiss a conversation between the first woman and a talking
        snake (Genesis 3) as myth or allegory, in much the same way as Jesus
        claiming to be a gate (John 10:7) is clearly metaphorical.<br>
        But the fact remains that there are all kinds of problems.<br>
        There are historical problems and inconsistencies.<br>
        For example, what was the fate of Judas Iscariot ?<br>
        (Matthew 27:3 and Acts 1:18 tell two different tales).<br>
        Who instructed David to take a census of the people of Israel ?<br>
        (God, according to 2 Samuel 24:1. Or Satan, according to I Chronicles
        21:1)<br>
        There are problems with genealogy and with numbers. 7000 men (1
        Chronicles 19:18) or 700 men (2 Samuel 10:18)<br>
        And there are moral problems...It is hard to read Psalm 137, and imagine
        that the "smashing of babies against rocks" (v.9), is the desire of our
        loving God.<br>
        <br>
        In a report to the Church of Scotland in 1998, the Panel of Doctrine
        addressed the subject of interpreting Scripture:<br>
        <em>"In upholding the Word of God contained in the Scriptures of the Old
          and New Testaments" we are not asserting that everything found in the
          Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments is the Word of God. Such an
          assertion might appear to require us to justify the slaughter of other
          races to make room for Israel, the number of wives King Solomon
          enjoyed, the wish to see babies of hostile adults battered on rocks.
          In our own century, too literal an identification of fragments of
          Scripture as "Word of God" has been made the pretext for Nazi
          oppression in Germany and for the apartheid supported by the Dutch
          Reformed Church in South Africa."<br>
        </em>(Church of Scotland:Panel on Doctrine p11/5)<br>
        <br>
        <em>"There are significant issues on which it is difficult to see one
          clear unambiguous "biblical" view.<br>
          It is natural that we should wish to be told "what the Bible says" on
          issues that concern us. But there is often no neat answer to the
          questions on which we seek clear solutions: for instance, questions of
          poverty, military service, corporal and capital punishment. Sometimes
          what we are really seeking is an affirmation of simplistic answers we
          think we already know.<br>
          <br>
          We should not feel defensive either about ambiguity or about mystery.
          Jesus in his teaching seldom gave quick easy answers. Often he
          responded to one question by asking another, or turned the question
          back on the questioner to expose the false suppositions (or the
          ulterior motive) underlying it. There are within the scriptures
          certain statements everyone would probably regard as seminal: eg In
          the beginning was the Word.... God so loved the world.... Judge not
          that ye be not judged.... I say seventy times seven.... God is
          love.... Yet even these distillations can hardly be said to stand
          entirely on their own... The Gospel in all its fullness cannot be
          expressed by means of soundbites or proof texts. Pastorally, we must
          try to help people reach the conviction that is born of search and
          enquiry, not conviction that suppresses all enquiry and regards any
          areas of doubt or complexity as sinful. If our faith does not involve
          development, growth, sometimes change, it bears little relation to the
          faith of the Apostles"<br>
        </em>(Panel on Doctrine P11/7)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;* Different kinds of Interpretations<br>
        - see sermon DESSERTS ? on three different ways of tackling the problem
        of evil - 1) fiddle the accounts (Chronicles)<br>
        <br>
        2) throw yer hands up in the air ("Teacher")<br>
        <br>
        3) protest and kick up a stink (Job)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        * Facing up to Contradictions/ Living with Paradox.<br>
        <br>
        A scriptural example....<br>
        Psalm 73 starts optimisically.<br>
        "God is indeed good to Israel<br>
        to those who have pure hearts" (GNB)<br>
        <br>
        "How good God is to Israel<br>
        How good to those who are pure in heart." (RSV)<br>
        Yet the psalm continues on as a great lament, as the psalmist struggles
        to make sense of the "success of the wicked" which poses a stumbling
        block to his faith in a just God.<br>
        How do these opening positive words tie in with the rest of the psalm ?<br>
        Davidson suggests three possibilities.<br>
        "1) These words are the theological starting point of the psalmist's
        difficulties. As such they must be taken as a summary of the faith in
        which the psalmist had been nurtured. Yes, says the psalmist, I know
        what I ought to believe; God's goodness is always demonstrated to his
        own faithful people. But my experience of life points in a very
        different direction. Out of this tension between inherited belief and
        personal experience his spiritual agony unfolds.<br>
        <br>
        2) The opening words of the psalm may be taken as the end product of the
        experience which the rest of the psalm describes; as if the psalmist
        were saying, "Listen, God is indeed good to his faithful people, I
        know..this is what I discovered as I struggled to make sense of life."<br>
        <br>
        3) These words represent BOTH the starting point of the psalmist's
        experience AND the end product of his experience. They can be both
        because in between the psalmist has been led to redefine what God's
        goodness means.<br>
        <br>
        Although strong arguments can be made in favour of any of those views,
        the third approach makes the most sense, since it is in this process of
        redefinition that much of the interest of the psalm lies."<br>
        (Davidson p32-33)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>5) HURTS</strong><br>
        * worldview problems - the existence of evil - (Yancey)<br>
        <br>
        * personal/family tragedy<br>
        <br>
        * anxiety/depression - hello fear - living with the "awful horror" - the
        letter<br>
        <br>
        * poverty/exclusion<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;* inability to bring these to worship - (Hobson) - criticism of
        church life<br>
        <br>
        * Godview problems - the "will of God".<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;On worship...<br>
        <em>"Why, when our suffering seems capricious and our lives meaningless,
          do the churches only read and sing the happy Psalms? Why don't we
          incorporate honest expressions of doubt and anguish into our modern
          worship? Why don't we proclaim from our pulpits and pronounce from our
          pews exactly what we often feel - that God has ignored us?"<br>
        </em>(Kelly Clark: When Faith Is Not Enough p10)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;In a study of the current hymnnal used by many mainline churches
        in the UK, (Church Hymnary 3rd Edition) Davidson has drawn attention to
        the fact that the criteria for selecting psalms has been to largely
        ignore the questioning and doubting and lamenting psalms. Psalms of
        lament that are included have largely been editted to remove those
        doubting elements.<br>
        <em>"Out of the 41 psalms of personal lament, only two remain with the
          lament element intact, both of them because of christological
          associations. The compilers (of the hymnary) seem to be saying that
          the lament element which is so prominent in the Old Testament Psalms
          has no point of contact with the experience or need of the worshipper
          today."<br>
        </em>(Davidson: The Courage to Doubt p14)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Psalms of praise and thanksgiving are well represented - psalms
        which express confusion or doubts, psalms which ask difficult questions
        or react against evil in the world have no place in this book. It would
        appear as if the modern worshipper does not have the same needs and
        questions as her Biblical counterpart.<br>
        <br>
        on the will of God...<br>
        <em>"All this is tied up with the "will-of-God-heresy." I cannot imagine
          how people can suppose that the cruel and horrible diseases that fall
          upon them are the will of God in any intelligent sense of the word.
          Who can trust a God who snatches a dear young wife and companion away
          by giving her a foul disease that eats away her beautiful body? Who is
          likely to trust a God who at any moment may snatch away a young
          husband at a time when he is just holding together his little family
          of wife and three young children? Who can trust a God who, to teach
          her that he is a loving father(!), deliberately wills that a bright,
          healthy girl of 15, a hockey player and a lover of open-air swimming,
          shall develop polio and lie for months with twisted and useless limbs?<br>
        </em><br>
        <em>If one wills anything, one wants it to happen. No one but a fiend
          could look upon a polio or cancer victim and say "That is what I
          wanted to happen"...I would not worship or trust a God like that for 5
          minutes, and to love him is impossible..let us not label a thing "the
          will of God" for which a man would be sent to a criminal lunatic
          asylum for the rest of his life.<br>
          <br>
          Let us keep the phrase "the will of God" for those things which God
          intends to happen, not those things which, because He allows evil, God
          allows to happen."<br>
        </em>(L D Weatherhead: Prescription for Anxiety p46f)<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;On pastoral support from the church...<br>
        <em>"The questions that challenge us most are raised by the clash in
          expectations between science and medicine, on one hand, and ancient
          ways of speaking about God. Among North Americans, there is a strong
          tension between people who champion the right of individual believers
          to find the kind of answers that will satisfy them personally, and
          others who argue that every believer must accept only the answers
          acceptable to the Church, based on long-established interpretations of
          Scripture and Doctrine...I do not find either of these choices
          adequate for pastors who must live through crisis and conflict with
          their people. Giving the right answer is not really the essence of
          pastoral care. Neither should we think of faith as a collecton of
          right answers stored up in our hearts and minds, ready when we need
          them."<br>
        </em>(Nancy Cocks: Pastoral Models p100-1)<br>
        <em><br>
          "When questions emerge in a life caught up in suffering, those
          questions are not really seeking an explanation. Faith seeking
          understanding is not faith seeking the right theological answer
          according to John Calvin or from the Presbyterian Church in Canada or
          Taiwan. A question raised from a broken heart seeks understanding as
          compassion, understanding that appreciates the agony or loss that
          troubles the soul. A question raised from a life in crisis seeks an
          opportunity to tell its story and lament lost love, lost opportunity
          or lost certainty. A question seeks a listener. A question seeks a
          companion who can explore the landscape of a broken heart and pick up
          the pieces of life, and hold these pieces tenderly.<br>
