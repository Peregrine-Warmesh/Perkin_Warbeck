</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let him who walks in </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the dark,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">who has no light,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">trust in the name of the Lord</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and rely on his God.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Isaiah 50:10</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) <FONT SIZE=5>THE NECESSARY STAGE ?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many paradoxes contained within the Christian faith. At the heart of faith in God itself is this one - that on the one hand God can be seen and known, and on the other hand God is mystery and hidden. (see Isaiah 45:15)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Old Testament paradox - that God can be known and God is hidden - provided the starting point for a book by Robert Davidson (The Courage to Doubt (1983)) exploring this theme.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Davidson demonstrated that doubts, questions, anger, and even rebellion found a valid place within the Bible, and that in worship there was an honesty perhaps lacking in churches today.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the Psalms are songs of worship resounding with all kinds of human emotions - they are hymns of praise and adoration and thankfulness, but they are also vehicles for expressing doubt, disappointment, anger and questioning God's provision and fairness in a world where often the innocent suffer and the wicked prosper.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The worshipping community of Israel found a place for expressing their real feelings to God, including their questions and doubts. They were able to see that <I>faith</I> and <I>doubt</I> lived together, and that this paradox was an essential part of their believing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the striking things about the psalms is how the psalmist can move from praise to doubt (and even back again), within a few verses of the same psalm. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A good example of this kind of tension is Psalm 74. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God's greatness is proclaimed:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"You created the day and the night; you set the sun and the moon in their places; you set the limits of the earth; you made summer and winter." (vs.16,17)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God's power to intervene and support is also acknowledged:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"You have been our king from the beginning, O God; you have saved us many times. With your mighty strength you divided the sea.." (vs.12,13)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet at the same time, the present reality seems to point to a God who has forgotten his people and chosen to ignore their plight, and this too is expressed in the hymn:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Why have you abandoned us like this, O God ?.. Why have you refused to help us ?.. Rouse yourself, God !.." (vs.1,11,22)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"It is important to grasp the tensions within this psalm: the tension between what the past affirms to be true and what the present seems to deny; the tension between believing that the key to God's nature is to be found in the idea of love and facing a situation in which there are no evident signs of such love. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have been brought up to affirm that God is a powerful, active, living God and live through an experience which seems to speak only of the triumph of ruthless and arrogant evil, how do you explain it ? Is God asleep ?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Robert Davidson: The Courage to Doubt p8) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doubts and questions affect us in different ways and in different times. What may greatly trouble one person will cause another to lose little sleep, and vice versa. Some people seem to be more pre-disposed towards doubting than others. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, what also is clear, is that doubting is part of the landscape of faith, and that there are times when we all have to face up to questions, and worries, and we wonder whether God is there, and if so, does this God actually care about us ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One minister, who survived a shooting incident, when the gunman firing on him missed at point blank range, was encouraged by his friends. "Your guardian angel was looking after you." "God was protecting you." Being a man of faith, he was happy to agree with these versions of events.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then he remembered a minister colleague and his wife, murdered recently in their homes by intruders. Where were their guardian angels on that night ? Where was God's protection for them ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(see Dunn: Don't Just Stand There)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are different sources of doubts, and they may affect us in different times and in different ways. Here are a few.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a) INTELLECTUAL PROBLEMS WITH CHRISTIAN TEACHING.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examples of this would include addressing the trustworthiness of the Bible, or situations where church teaching is in conflict with an individual's own moral stance, or tackling an issue of doctrine.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(It seems that most books written on "doubt" seem to deal particularly with this kind of thing with a heavy emphasis on correct teaching or doctrine)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b) A SENSE OF THE "ABSENCE" OF GOD. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God may appear unreal or distant. Many people have written about this, from the psalmist, King David, St John of the Cross, Martin Luther and more recently, Martin Buber.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The Bible knows of God's hiding his face, of times when the contact between heaven and earth semes to be interrupted. God seems to withdraw himself utterly from the earth and no longer to participate in its existence. The space of history is then full of noise, but as it were, empty of divine breath. For one who believes in the living God, who knows about him, and is fated to spend his life in a time of his hiddenness, it is very difficult to live."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Martin Buber: The Dialogue between Heaven and Earth)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c) RESPONDING TO TRAGEDY IN OUR LIVES OR IN THE LIVES OF OTHERS.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major trigger of doubt for Christians is the presence of tragedy. That the world should contain so much suffering when we believe in a loving, all-powerful God remains a mystery, and for some a real stumbling block to faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But even if we can accept (in an academic sense) this dilemma, when tragedy strikes at our own door, or at the door of someone we love, the problem presents itself in a much more forceful way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most influential Christian writers of our century, </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C.S. Lewis, discovered at the time of his wife's death, that God seemed completely absent. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And in this time of pain he wrote these words:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Meanwhile, where is God? This is one of the most disquieting symptoms. When you are happy, so happy that you have no sense of needing Him, so happy that you are tempted to feel His claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and turn to Him with gratitude and praise, you will be - or so it feels -welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence. You may as well turn away. The longer you wait the more emphatic the silence will become. There are no lights in the windows. It might be an empty house. Was it ever inhabited? It seemed so once. And that seeming was as strong as this. What can this mean? Why is He so present a commander in our time of prosperity and so very absent a help in time of trouble?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(C.S. Lewis: A Grief Observed)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d) FACING UP TO OUR OWN IMMORTALITY</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are situations we can encounter where we take on thoughts about ultimate value - we are addressing the meaning of life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are honest, most of our busyness in day to day living helps us to conveniently avoid the searching questions about purpose. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people would claim to be uninterested in questions like:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Is there a God ? Does life have meaning ? Is there a purpose to humankind's existence ?" </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such questions would be the domain of philisophical or religious "types".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet no one can go through life without at some time asking themselves the question "Does MY life have purpose ? Does MY life have value ?" </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Fowler, a professor at Candler School of Theology, spoke of how he once woke up in the middle of the night thinking about his death. What would his death mean ? And, in the end, what would his life have meant ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"During these moments I was not <I>in</I> my faith. I seemed to stand completely naked - a soul without body, raiment or roles. A soul alone with what ? With whom ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith is a coat against this nakedness. For most of us, most of the time, faith functions so as to screen off the abyss of mystery that surrounds us. But we all at certain times, call upon faith to provide nerve to stand in the presence of the abyss - naked, stripped of life supports, trusting only in the the being, the mercy, and the power of the Other in the darkness."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ADDITIONAL WORRY</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith and doubt stand together, as two sides of the same fence, and the living of our spiritual lives involves the acceptance of this tension. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "down-side" of doubt, obviously, is that it makes us feel insecure, and makes us question the reality or the validity of what our faith would profess. For the person of faith, doubt is not usually welcome. Given a free vote, we would want to get rid of doubt altogether. It is much more comfortable to stand on the "faith" side of the fence.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But what if (at any moment of time), we cannot do that ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What if our doubts are real ? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suppressing questions and doubts will not make them go away. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing we do not need, is to add to our troubles the <I>additional</I> worry that there is something defective in us - as if we are in some ways inferior Christians.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A disturbing trend in our modern church is to see individual doubts as indicative of defective reasoning or immaturity or intellectual weakness.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doubts are often portrayed as a problem to be solved, an obstacle to be removed, a sign of immaturity, or a symptom of weak faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Os Guinness includes the following categories as "families" of doubt - a faulty view of God, lack of growth, lack of commitment, ingratitude, and weak foundations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(see Os Guinness: Doubt - Faith in Two Minds)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alister McGrath tends to follow the same line, suggesting that we could do better:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Doubt is a sign that we've neglected our relationship with God."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Alister McGrath: Doubt p112)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"It is helpful to think of doubt as a symptom of human frailty, of our reluctance to trust God." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(McGrath p10)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Words like these suggest that doubts are something that are our own fault - almost something to be ashamed of.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">McGrath explores the difference beween <I>justification</I> (being put right with God as a result of faith) and <I>sanctification</I> (the gradual change in character and thinking which emerges over time) to show that doubts are symbolic of being between the two stages - symbolic of an immature faith which has not had time to develop.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be cases where this is true. Doubts may be caused by insufficient understanding of faith, and doubts may be caused by our unwillingness to explore faith adequately, but is this really the whole story ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not the case that doubts may arise in someone who has a very clear understanding of faith, or indeed in someone who has found that her very willingness to truly explore her beliefs have resulted in her doubts ?!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfair to think, (as some Christians seem to do), that doubting is a byproduct of sitting lightly to faith. As if those who doubt, invariably do so casually. In this scenario, doubting appears like some kind of intellectual game played out in a pub discussion about what Christianity is all about, or whether the church has had its day. Often in these kinds of discussions the stakes are not high and the protagonists enjoy a good argument.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some people doubt is much more of a <U>real</U> problem. It's not neccesarily so much about the historicity of Christianity or wondering about the empty Easter tomb - it's trying to square what you have <I>already</I> believed with life's experiences <I>now</I>. This tension, as evidenced in the quotations above from Psalm 74, is all too painful for some Christians today. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is such a thing as honest doubting, and while that may not be a comfortable place to be, it is sad that many people are also having to struggle with an "unneccesarily guilty conscience." (Robert Davidson: The Courage to Doubt pxi)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a book of his sermons, Frederick Beuchner said:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Love must be freely given. Love must live in the freedom not to love; it must take risks. Love must be prepared to suffer even as Jesus on the Cross suffered and part of that suffering is doubt, even as Jesus on the Cross doubted."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DISPOSING OF DOUBT ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps doubts should be thought of in much the same way as other maladies. A headache can be cured in an hour after taking a pill, pneumonia may last a couple of months, and a weak back may be a permanent feature. Not all doubts will come and go in the same way. Not all can be displaced with the same remedy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some doubts can be disposed of very quickly through a better grasp of what faith is about, or by laying to rest a misconception - in other words, a simple matter of reading the right book or speaking to a responsible Christian who is able to "put you right". This is obviously true where doubt is a matter of a lack of knowledge or understanding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But other doubts can take a passage of time to work through - it would be insensitive in the extreme to suggest that someone who has been recently bereaved should be able to dispense with fears, doubts and questions at the drop of a hat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still other doubts may have to be accepted and lived with on a long-term basis - such is the paradox of faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kelly James Clark, associate professor of philosophy at Calvin College in Michigan, wrote about the Christian self-help books which seem to promise a ten step plan which will put your life on course and solve any problem:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The manuals treat doubt as one would a headache, a broken arm, or athlete's foot. Simply following the doctor's orders, applying the quick remedy, or popping a pill will relieve both symptoms and malady. But doubt is really more like athritis, nearsightedness, and the common cold. These are not neccesarily terminal ailments, but they are not easily curable either. Some of their symptoms can be masked for a while, but sooner rather than later they will manifest themselves, sometimes quite powerfully. These are ailments we must simply learn to live with, even though learning to live with them is not something we desire or welcome. So too with doubt: it is a malady that we shouldn't relish or glorify, but we must make do with it." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Kelly Clark: When Faith Is Not Enough p96)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The story of Job in the Old Testament is a classic treatment of faith and doubt. In the light of extreme adversity, Job has to make sense of his faith in a just and loving God. Why has such calamity fallen on him ? What has he done to deserve this ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one way, Job is disappointing, for at the end of the book the reader is yet to discover a neat rational answer to the problem. Yet there are important lessons to be learned from the book.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firstly, Job's friends (who take the traditional line on God and suffering), are discredited.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They tell Job that this suffering is God teaching him a lesson (see 5:17), the result of sin in his life (see 4:7), and that God will give him good fortune as soon as he mends his ways (see 8:3-6)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final "friend", a man called Elihu, takes a different line. He is not ready to agree with the others on this. But he condemns Job's questioning of God as itself a sin. Job asks too many questions, according to Elihu. (see 35:16)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But God is not happy with any of these thoughts. The simplistic views that there is no mystery to suffering are not good enough. It is NOT the case that suffering is a "deserved punishment" for sin. It is NOT the case that Job is sinning by bringing his concerns to God.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"You did not speak the truth to me, as my servant Job did."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(42:7) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's worth recalling the words of Christ, confronted by a blind man, in John Chapter 9. The disciples ask Jesus whether the sin of the man or the parents of the man are to blame for the man's blindness. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jesus replies "Neither" (v3) Disability isn't a punishment for sin sent from God. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On another occasion, Jesus refers to a local disaster at Siloam to make the same point. The people killed when the tower fell were no worse than anyone else. Misfortunes and disasters are not punishments sent by God. (see Luke 13:4)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life can go wrong for us. But that is not a sign of God's punishment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, Job does not find that God grants him an answer to his problem, but he discovers that God is with him in his pain and is able to give him hope for the future. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God confronts Job with the complexity of creation, and Job's inability to understand all things. God's ways are more complicated than human ways. The roots of life (and suffering) are entwined in vast and complex relationships which we mortals could never fully grasp.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, God grants to Job the knowledge that his love and care continues to surround him and will sustain him, as well as the reassurance that misfortune is NOT some punishment sent from on high.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, Job is able to have grounds for continuing to believe and trust in God. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Job discovers that this so-called impious questioning and confrontation with God is not out of place but perfectly reasonable and even neccesary. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only after thinking and debating and wrestling with the issues and "taking God on", that Job is able to make his decision to continue in faith. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only by refusing to lie down to the simplistic explanations of others and instead by being brave enough to confront the feelings of doubts and confusion that he feels that he is able to overcome them and move on to a deeper faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God is big enough to respond to Job's expressions of doubts and confusion. And Job is justified in presenting this side of himself to God. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Withholding lament betrays a lack of fidelity. When we express our anguish to God, we draw God into our experience. To avoid God stoically in times of suffering or to maintain piously that "all is well" when we know good and well that it isn't - this prevents God from fully entering into our believing experience. The life of authentic faith demands raging at God when we want to know "Why"?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Job is offered not only God's message, but also God himself. Part of the message of Job is that we needn't suffer impassively. We can even thrust our anger upon God. Our hope is that, as for Job, God will meet us with his grace. Many Christians think it is inappropriate to express their anger and frustrations to God.....We think we honour God with our false praise, but we don't. God is big enough and cares enough to bear our anger. God graciously meets the blasphemer with a vision of his power and goodness. And when we, like Job, receive this healing balm, we no longer need to find completely rational answers."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Kelly Clark: When Faith Is Not Enough p89) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset, we need to accept three things:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firstly, that there are times when God <I>will</I> seem absent, unreal or distant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, that honesty may compel us to doubt or ask searching questions of our faith, and that asking these questions is okay.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And thirdly, that doubts and questions may be a neccesary stage for us on the road to spiritual maturity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) <FONT SIZE=5>SPIRITUAL STAGES</FONT> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A woman called Alice came to see me with regard to joining the church. She was middle-aged, and belonged originally to England. She had joined a church down there but that was many years ago and she felt it would be neccesary to rejoin. At this point Alice had been coming quite regularly to services in the church.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was aware of the vows of membership for the Church of Scotland, but she had a minor problem with one of them - such a minor problem that I cannot now remember what it was ! </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was not sure that she believed something in quite the way she felt she would be expected to believe and this was causing her some distress. In fact she was quite tearful about it. She felt certain she wanted to join the church but she knew she had to be honest about what she truly believed and truly doubted.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the end, after some discussion, everything was sorted out and she felt able to join the congregation, which she did.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What I <I>do</I> remember about that situation was my reaction to her visit after she had gone. "Thank God for that woman !" I thought to myself. "Thank God for this person who cares so much and takes her faith so seriously that she would worry so much about it!"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people who join the church do so at a relatively young age after a period of instruction and information as to what is involved. At one time, when church membership was higher, this was almost one rite of passage into adulthood for young people in Christian homes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even now, joining the church through profession of faith, seems relatively easy to those who come forward for membership. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alice was making heavy weather of it. She was a person who was aware of her doubts. And yet I sensed in her a maturity, and a seriousness about her faith that has since been borne out.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Incidently, when personal tragedy struck at my own door, a little later on, Alice was one of the few church members to write personally to me, and of those who did, every single one had themselves been through very difficult circumstances in their own lives).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point here is that a mature faith is not neccesarily a faith that is exempt from doubts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact, doubts themselves may be a sign of maturity. For doubts can come from asking questions and not being afraid to take faith seriously. For many people, their <I>reluctance</I> to ask questions is a sign of the superficiality of their faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a implicit tendency in the church to applaud anyone who does not suffer from doubt. "Their faith is strong," we reason.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That just might be true. But there is another possibility. Maybe their faith is just not important enough, or being taken seriously enough, to reach a stage where doubts may surface.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same way, there is the tendency to suggest that a person who <I>does</I> suffer from doubts is unspiritual, or neglecting their faith, when in fact, the exact opposite may be true.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may come as a surprise to many pastors and church leaders to think of the questioning or doubting members of their congregation as showing signs of spiritual maturity. Usually such people are criticised or pitied, rather than thought of in a positive light. It may come as a surprise to many that there are such things as "spiritual stages" at all. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone once said that growth is the only proof of life. Growth and development are true of every area of our lives. This includes our spirituality. At any time, our spiritual stage will determine how we respond to faith and how we regard the people around us within the faith community. Our spiritual stage will influence our attitudes and behaviour.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SPIRITUAL STAGES</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the recent thinking on the idea of "stages" derives from the work of Professor James Fowler of Candler School of Theology in Atlanta.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(see Stages of Faith, Faith Develpoment and Pastoral Care etc)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fowler suggests six categories of faith to which he gives his own descriptive titles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Chaotic faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Ordering faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) Conforming faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) Choosing/Either-or faith </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5) Balanced/Inclusive faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6) Selfless faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subtleties abound in this classification. People can be moving between stages at vastly different times of life - some never progress beyond certain stages, and very few reach what Fowler would classify as stage 6. The differences between the classifications themselves can be slight, and more recently others have tried to simplify the categories while acknowledging their debt to Fowler's work.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, John Westerhoff speaks of four distinctive styles of faith. These can be correlated to Fowler's stages.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Experienced faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Affiliative faith</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) Owned faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(see "Will Our Children Have Faith ?" pp90)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most straightforward of simplications has been suggested by M. Scott Peck in different writings, in particular "The Different Drum".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peck suggests four categories. These redefined stages retain the basic thrust of Fowler's own.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Chaotic, antisocial</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Formal, institutional</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) Sceptic, individual</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) Mystic, communal</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(see "The Different Drum" pp187-200)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stage 1 represents an undeveloped spirituality, common to children and some adults. Stage 2 represents perhaps the majority of churchgoers, where the emphasis is on the "form" rather than the "essence" of religion. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stage 3 represents many non-believers, yet the kind of person within this group is most likely to be more spiritually "developed" than those in Stage 2.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stage 4 represents the working through of questions and doubts of Stage 3 to a really owned and mature faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously these stages have implications for the church community in its dealings with (and understanding of) those non-believers with whom there is no present connection.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the crunch for the church internally, seems to be how to deal with believers moving from Stage 2 into Stage 3. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can they be held within the household of faith? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we big enough to include the questions and the questioners?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SPHERES OF CONFLICT</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existence of different stages of faith result in two potential spheres of conflict. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* There is an issue for the church itself to face up to. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can the church satisfy the different needs of its members, and particulary keep a grasp of those who find themselves on the borders of its fellowship ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* There is an issue for individuals here too. The transition from one spiritual stage to another is not often smooth. God may be behind it all, but it doesn't seem like God ! </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONFLICT WITHIN THE CHURCH.........</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Evidence suggests that the majority of adults in our society arrest or equilibrate in the Ordering or Conforming Stage."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Fowler: "Weaving the New Creation" p21)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The difficulty is that (Stage 2) people do not see the possibility of anything different from their own position being valid."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("How Faith Grows" p68)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These quotes illustrate a big problem for the churches. Sticking with Peck's classifications, we could say that the great majority of church-going people would be best described as Stage Two people. For these people, (and these people would include some ministers and church leaders) the "form" rather than the "essence" of religion is most important.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(This goes some way to explaining the reluctance of so many church people to "change" within the liturgy or practice of their own church or denomination.)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their strengths would include, trust, faithfulness and dedication to the church, and many people in this category would prove to be loyal, hardworking, members of their local congregation, contributing much of themselves into the wider life of the fellowship. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The weaknesses here would include a view of "change" within the structure of the denomination (or in worship) to be invariably a negative influence to be resisted, and an inability to accomodate the views of other Christians, especially those who are particularly sceptical or questioning.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, the most comfortable position to be in as a current church member is to be quietly accepting of faith rather than asking questions of it. And for people moving in to a time when they feel that questions have to be asked and faith has to be explored, it can seem as if they are on the outskirts of the faith community or even outside it. As a result, there are many people who feel they have to leave the church (and who do), because either they have moved away from God, or the people in the fellowship imply there is something wrong with them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge for the church is to allow for openness and exploration. The feeling that we must "keep a lid" on questions and doubts leads to a double problem. On the one hand, there is a sense of exclusion for those who feel unable to suppress their questions or doubts, and on the other hand, pressure on everyone else in the faith community not to <I>own up</I> to their own questions or admit to doubts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The refusal to face up to doubt, does not take doubt away. It rather prevents us from moving into maturity in our faith. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dangers have been outlined on different occasions by two Christian psychiatrists, anxious to maintain that spiritual health involves the existence of doubts within faith: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"For the most part the churches have not yet learned that the best way to pass from defensive rationalisations to secure faith is to let doubts, inconsistencies, confusions and rebellions come out into the open instead of using various forms of spiritual coertion to keep them hidden or to draw them from awareness altogether." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(D.E. Roberts, quoted by Davidson p17)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scott Peck bemoans the church's "discouragement, through the ages, of doubt. In so doing it has consistently driven growing people out of its potential community, often fixating them thereby in a perpetual resistance to spiritual insights. Conversely, the church is not going to meet this challenge until doubt is properly considered a Christian virtue - indeed a Christian responsibility. We neither can nor should skip over questioning in our development." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(M. Scott Peck: "The Different Drum" p200)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Security in faith does not come through ignoring or bypassing doubts but accepting them and dealing with the reality of them. In the end, our doubts may then be put behind us, or we may come to the understanding that our doubts are there with us as companions on life's journey. Either way, we will be the stronger by having the courage to confront what honesty compels us to address in our own lives.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an age when the church feels itself to be on the defensive, and having to stand up to a world where so many people feel there is no role for the church, it can appear natural to assume that Christians must draw firm positions on matters of faith, and demonstrate a "fixed" position on issues of doctrine, morals and biblical interpretation. And it is easy to see why, in such a climate, that doubters and questioners within the church are seen as hampering this work, and diluting the faith which is so threatened. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet it is this very inflexibility, and inability of churches to accept different standpoints, and to allow for stages of growth, which is hampering the work of the Kingdom, and implicitly (if not explicitly) excluding many unnecessarily, from the faith community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The church must learn this: that it is alright for people to ask questions of their faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Some churches and ministers have abandoned theological defensiveness. They allow people to bring their questions into the sanctuary without insisting on the acceptance of pre-packed answers. They recognise that the processes of doubt and anger are part of the mystery of the spiritual life and have to be included in God. Christians on the theological edge, if they are wise, will not be in a hurry to find answers, anyway. They are usually people who have learned that it is alright to ask questions. Indeed, they have come to understand that faith is a way of living with questions, without being afraid."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Richard Holloway: Dancing on the Edge pxiii)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* CONFLICT WITHIN THE PERSON.........</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existence of these different spiritual stages, opens up a greater understanding of faith for ourselves and others. As we have seen, it poses various challenges for the church. In addition, it poses questions for us all as individuals. Where are we on our faith journey ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing that questions and doubts may be part of the spiritual "stage" we are at, may be helpful and reassuring up to a point. But it cannot take away the fact that moving into such a stage is painful. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is true to say that questions and doubts can sometimes be seen as a move towards maturity and away from superficiality, that does not mean that the process is painless. It is often quite the reverse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"In entering a new Stage there is often the experience of the dark night of the soul. There is a time when God is the abyss, the void, or the ENEMY. The structure may be unconscious, but the experience of that transition is very much conscious and most often painful."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Fowler: "Life Maps" p138)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could it be, that if it is neccesary for us to journey through a spiritual time of questioning, resulting in doubting, that God is actually behind that process ? If we believe that our spiritual journey is guided by God, it would suggest that the stages on the way of that journey could be initiated by God too. Scott Peck believes this to be the case. Every move between spiritual stages represents, for him, a neccesary conversion to a deeper understanding of faith. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"As part of the process of spiritual growth, the transition from Stage 2 to stage 3 is also a conversion. We can be converted to atheism or agnosticism or at least, scepticism ! Indeed I have every reason to believe that God has a hand in this part of the conversion process as well."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Peck: The Different Drum p199)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hard to find yourself in a place of doubting, perhaps after years of feeling that faith was secure from such doubts. An effect of the doubts is often to seem to drive a wedge between you and the God that once was seen so clearly. To appreciate that the period of doubting might be understood as part of God's plan for your spiritual development, is to discover a measure of hope and security amidst the questions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) <FONT SIZE=5>GOD OR THE "SYSTEM" ?</P>
</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some years ago I began a hunt for a comic book I had loved as a child. It was a story set in the time of the Polish-Cossack wars of the seventeenth century - not exactly the best known time of history for me. I had never come across the real novel written by Henryk Sienkiewicz, ("With Fire and Sword"), but this comic book version I remembered as my favourite book for some time. Many of the drawings in it I could picture instantly in my head. In fact, I could still remember some of the dialogue between characters. Not bad for a book I hadn't seen in 35 years !</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some reason, I became anxious to find it again, and to recapture the magic of the story. However, tracking this book down was not easy. From time to time I would look around second hand comic shops but to no avail. One proprietor in Glasgow told me there would be "no problem" getting a hold of it, but years later, he still hasn't managed to do so !</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then one day, in holiday in Vancouver, quite by chance, I discovered the book.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was great to find it, and I am glad to have it, yet I have to admit that it was not the wonderful and magical story I imagined (and half thought I <I>remembered</I>), it to be. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My imagination had been fuelled by a longing for something, hidden in the past or so I believed, but when at last I had it in my possession the fact was that the "magic" had gone. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This experience of longing, fuelled by imagination, is common to people of all ages. The Christian writer C.S. Lewis was particularly fascinated by this subject, believing that the existence of longing was highly significant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Lewis addressed these experiences of longing and yearning, he suggested that they were themselves pointers to a greater reality outside our rational world. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise. The longing which arises in us when we first fall in love, or first think of some foreign country, or first take up some subject that excites us, are longings which no marriage, no travel, no learning, can really satisfy."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(C.S. Lewis: Mere Christianity p119)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For Lewis, these unfulfilled dreams or longings were not to be disdained or rejected but rather cherished and treasured. For they were signs of a deeper and greater reality. They were a God-given hunger which could never be satisfied in this world and in this life. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(C.S. Lewis: Mere Christianity p119f)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, C.S. Lewis was fascinated by this sense of longing - a sense of something beckoning but something which we could never quite reach - never quite attain - it was always over the next hill or beyond the next bend in the road.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not <I>in</I> them, it only came <I>through</I> them, and what came through them was longing.....They are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(C S Lewis: The Weight of Glory p8)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commenting on these words, Richard Holloway observes that "Lewis points to the fundamental truth, which is the provisionality of all systems, religious or secular, as well as their symbols and instruments. The glory may come through them but is not to be identified with them. All sorts of things can mediate meaning, mediate the divine, but they are not themselves the meaning, not themselves divine."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Richard Holloway: Dancing on the Edge p47f) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot comprehend and worship God without pictures and images and symbols and rites. The trouble is that these symbols and pratices and traditions and ways of explaining our faith become themselves all important. And to question this system appears to be the same as questioning God himself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there is an important difference between doubting God himself and doubting the "system" built up around God.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The System ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* Fundamentalism</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* The Bible</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* Propositional faith</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* Cafeteria Christians</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Christianity invites us to a generous and open-hearted commitment to God, though not neccesarily to the words we use to talk about God or the systems we develop to respond to God. However, there is a tendency in Christianity to load everything with theological significance, thereby making reappraisals of traditional attitudes unusually difficult."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Richard Holloway: Dancing on the Edge pxiv)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trouble with propositional faith is that it promotes an understanding of faith which is "take it or leave it". There is no room for discussion or alternative views or debate. Disbelieve the system at any one point and you are on the "outside". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You must take the whole thing or leave the whole thing.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"> (Maturity and Living with Paradox)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The search for truth is fundamental to life. For Christians this search is central and of paramount importance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simone Weil once advised that whenever we had to choose between truth and Christ we must choose truth, because Christ is truth before he is anything else, and if we choose truth we cannot go far without falling into his arms again.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking for truth is a lifelong occupation. Humility is needed in large doses. Perhaps it is best to follow Edward de Bono in seeing truth more as a direction than a destination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"How many people actually want to live at the North Pole ? I suspect that very few people actually want to live on a sheet of ice in the cold. But how many people use "north" as a direction for navigating a boat, flying an airliner, hiking through the country, setting directions on a map or architect's plan, etc ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously "north" is much more useful as a "direction" than as a "destination". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is somewhat the same with "truth". We want the truth. We try to find the truth. We do science to find the truth. Truth is a wonderful direction in which to be heading.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Truth as a "destination" gives us values and certainty. It can also give us arrogance and persecution: "I have the truth, therefore everyone else must be wrong." "</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Edward de Bono: Textbook of Wisdom p74)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith always lives in tension with doubt.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opposite of faith is not doubt - it is certainty !</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For where we have certainty we have no need for faith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* Maturity - and the principle of multi-determinism. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As modern society moves more and more away from mystery, and as we continue to persuade ourselves of our own ability to find answers to all questions, there is a tendency to look for simplistic answers to every situation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complex political situations are rendered straightforward by our media's attempts to portray matters in black and white terms with "goodies" and "baddies".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complex arguments on issues as diverse as immigration, homosexuality, and abortion are often made to appear straightforward by individuals who emphasise one simplistic view at the expense of thinking seriously about other points of view.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maturity means being able to see complexities and avoid pre- packaged simplistic answers to life's questions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This kind of reflecting and thinking over responses is an indication not only of maturity but also of care and concern.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caring parents will not instantly jump to decisions when, for example, their teenage daughter comes to them with a request, but will want to think about what is involved, and reflect on the pros and cons of the situation before deciding. Their child may not always be pleased with the parental response but she will know that they have taken her request seriously and considered it carefully and not simply provided a knee-jerk reaction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A good example of the need for reflection and avoiding simplistic explanations is in our handling of Scripture itself. Christians believe that the Bible is the Word of God. But what do we mean by that ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bible presents us with many dilemmas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may dismiss a conversation between the first woman and a talking snake (Genesis 3) as myth or allegory, in much the same way as Jesus claiming to be a gate (John 10:7) is clearly metaphorical.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the fact remains that there are all kinds of problems.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are historical problems and inconsistencies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, what was the fate of Judas Iscariot ? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Matthew 27:3 and Acts 1:18 tell two different tales).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who instructed David to take a census of the people of Israel ?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(God, according to 2 Samuel 24:1. Or Satan, according to I Chronicles 21:1)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems with geneology and with numbers. 7000 men (1 Chronicles 19:18) or 700 men (2 Samuel 10:18)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And there are moral problems...It is hard to read Psalm 137, and imagine that the "smashing of babies against rocks" (v.9), is the desire of our loving God.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a report to the Church of Scotland in 1998, the Panel of Doctrine addressed the subject of interpreting Scripture:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"In upholding the Word of God contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments" we are not asserting that everything found in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments is the Word of God. Such an assertion might appear to require us to justify the slaughter of other races to make room for Israel, the number of wives King Solomon enjoyed, the wish to see babies of hostile adults battered on rocks. In our own century, too literal an identification of fragments of Scripture as "Word of God" has been made the pretext for Nazi oppression in Germany and for the apartheid supported by the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Church of Scotland:Panel on Doctrine p11/5)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"There are significant issues on which it is difficult to see one clear unambiguous "biblical" view.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is natural that we should wish to be told "what the Bible says" on issues that concern us. But there is often no neat answer to the questions on which we seek clear solutions: for instance, questions of poverty, military service, corporal and capital punishment. Sometimes what we are really seeking is an affirmation of simplistic answers we think we already know.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not feel defensive either about ambiguity or about mystery. Jesus in his teaching seldom gave quick easy answers. Often he responded to one question by asking another, or turned the question back on the questioner to expose the false suppositions (or the ulterior motive) underlying it. There are within the scriptures certain statements everyone would probably regard as seminal: eg In the beginning was the Word.... God so loved the world.... Judge not that ye be not judged.... I say seventy times seven.... God is love.... Yet even these distillations can hardly be said to stand entirely on their own... The Gospel in all its fullness cannot be expressed by means of soundbites or proof texts. Pastorally, we must try to help people reach the conviction that is born of search and enquiry, not conviction that suppresses all enquiry and regards any areas of doubt or complexity as sinful. If our faith does not involve development, growth, sometimes change, it bears little relation to the faith of the Apostles"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do these opening positive words tie in with the rest of the psalm ? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Davidson suggests three possibilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"1) These words are the theological starting point of the psalmist's difficulties. As such they must be taken as a summary of the faith in which the psalmist had been nurtured. Yes, says the psalmist, I know what I ought to believe; God's goodness is always demonstrated to his own faithful people. But my experience of life points in a very different direction. Out of this tension between inherited belief and personal experience his spiritual agony unfolds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) The opening words of the psalm may be taken as the end product of the experience which the rest of the psalm describes; as if the psalmist were saying, "Listen, God is indeed good to his faithful people, I know..this is what I discovered as I struggled to make sense of life."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) These words represent BOTH the starting point of the psalmist's experience AND the end product of his experience. They can be both because in between the psalmist has been led to redefine what God's goodness means. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although strong arguments can be made in favour of any of those views, the third approach makes the most sense, since it is in this process of redefinition that much of the interest of the psalm lies."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Out of the 41 psalms of personal lament, only two remain with the lament element intact, both of them because of christological associations. The compilers (of the hymnary) seem to be saying that the lament element which is so prominent in the Old Testament Psalms has no point of contact with the experience or need of the worshipper today."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Psalms of praise and thanksgiving are well represented - psalms which express confusion or doubts, psalms which ask difficult questions or react against evil in the world have no place in this book. It would appear as if the modern worshipper does not have the same needs and questions as her Biblical counterpart.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">on the will of God...</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"All this is tied up with the "will-of-God-heresy." I cannot imagine how people can suppose that the cruel and horrible diseases that fall upon them are the will of God in any intelligent sense of the word. Who can trust a God who snatches a dear young wife and companion away by giving her a foul disease that eats away her beautiful body? Who is likely to trust a God who at any moment may snatch away a young husband at a time when he is just holding together his little family of wife and three young children? Who can trust a God who, to teach her that he is a loving father(!), deliberately wills that a bright, healthy girl of 15, a hockey player and a lover of open-air swimming, shall develop polio and lie for months with twisted and useless limbs? </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one <I>wills</I> anything, one <I>wants</I> it to happen. No one but a fiend could look upon a polio or cancer victim and say "That is what I <I>wanted</I> to happen"...I would not worship or trust a God like that for 5 minutes, and to love him is impossible..let us not label a thing "the will of God" for which a man would be sent to a criminal lunatic asylum for the rest of his life. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us keep the phrase "the will of God" for those things which God <I>intends</I> to happen, not those things which, because He allows evil, God allows to happen."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On pastoral support from the church...</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The questions that challenge us most are raised by the clash in expectations between science and medicine, on one hand, and ancient ways of speaking about God. Among North Americans, there is a strong tension between people who champion the right of individual believers to find the kind of answers that will satisfy them personally, and others who argue that every believer must accept only the answers acceptable to the Church, based on long-established interpretations of Scripture and Doctrine...I do not find either of these choices adequate for pastors who must live through crisis and conflict with their people. Giving the right answer is not really the essence of pastoral care. Neither should we think of faith as a collecton of right answers stored up in our hearts and minds, ready when we need them."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Nancy Cocks: Pastoral Models p100-1)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"When questions emerge in a life caught up in suffering, those questions are not really seeking an explanation. Faith seeking understanding is not faith seeking the right theological answer according to John Calvin or from the Presbyterian Church in Canada or Taiwan. A question raised from a broken heart seeks understanding as compassion, understanding that appreciates the agony or loss that troubles the soul. A question raised from a life in crisis seeks an opportunity to tell its story and lament lost love, lost opportunity or lost certainty. A question seeks a listener. A question seeks a companion who can explore the landscape of a broken heart and pick up the pieces of life, and hold these pieces tenderly.</P>
