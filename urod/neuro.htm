<h2><font face="Arial">Neurological control.</font></h2>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">The muscles of the bladder,
urethra and pelvic floor are under the control of the nervous
system. A simplified picture would be that as the bladder fills,
sensory receptors in the bladder wall trigger the micturition
reflex - a simultaneous contraction of the detrusor and
relaxation of the urethral and periurethral muscles. The
neurological signals for these actions are co-ordinated by a
micturition centre. Two locations are currently postulated for
the site of the micturition reflex:</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">The traditional view had been that
the site was located entirely in the sacral part of the cord,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">A current hypothesis proposed by
De Groat, Blaivas and others suggests that the reflex is not
located solely in the sacral spine but rather in the pontine part
of the brain stem much higher up. To support this hypothesis he
quotes results from patients with </font><a href="spine.htm"><font
size="4" face="Arial">spinal lesions</font></a><font size="4"
face="Arial">. If the micturition reflex is purely sacral then
suprasacral lesions of the spine should result in physiological
voiding. However in Blavais' series of 155 patient with definite
suprasacral lesions, only 41 % showed normal voiding with
detrusor - external sphincter dyssynegia in 34% and detrusor
areflexia in 35%.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">If the micturition reflex had
total control over voiding, micturition would occur automatically
at certain bladder volumes and this is the case with babies and
depending on the level of the lesion, some </font><a
href="spine.htm"><font size="4" face="Arial">spinally injured</font></a><font
size="4" face="Arial"> patients. However as the diagram shows,
the brain has an interaction with the pontine micturition centre
and voiding can be inhibited. When voiding is desired the
voluntary control of the reflex is removed and voiding should
take place in a co-ordinated fashion. Thus an intact spinal cord
is required for voluntary control of micturition.</font></p>
