<h1><font face="Arial"><strong>Ambulatory Urodynamics</strong></font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>This technique has only relatively
recently become available. It relies on small catheter tip
transducers and a portable recording system. As well as pressure
any leakage is measured to within a few ml by a recording pad.
The department at SGH is the only one in Scotland currently
performing these tests. The clinical indication for the use of
the technique would be cases where the symptoms of urgency and
frequency point to an unstable bladder but static urodynamics
failed to show it. Since ambulatory urodynamics also shows up
leakage it is ideal for testing for genuine stress incontinence
(GSI).</strong></font></p>

<p><a href="ics.htm#gsi"><font face="Arial"><strong>GSI</strong></font></a><font
face="Arial"><strong> is the involuntary leakage of urine in the
absence of unstable bladder. It can sometimes be mimicked by an
unstable bladder which is triggered by a cough. Thus the symptom
is coincident with a stress event and is misdiagnosed as stress
incontinence. Prior to the routine use of urodynamics many
surgical procedures were carried out to correct what was thought
to be stress incontinence. However many failed because the
problem was really instability. GSI can be tested for using a
static urodynamics system but there is limit to how much stress
the patient can be made to do. With an ambulatory system
realistic everyday stresses can be recreated.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The figure below shows a normal
ambulatory trace lasting 30 minutes. The traces show (from the
top) abdominal (rectal) pressure Pabd, intravesical pressure
(Pves) detrusor pressure (Pdet) and leakage (Vol). The high
compliance of the slow fill detrusor is seen. There is no
instability and no leakage.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The diagram shows a one hour trace
with several episodes of leakage. At this time scale it is not
possible to analyse the cause of the leakage. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>This trace shows genuine stress
incontinence. The noisy traces are caused by the patient jumping
up and down. Most but not all of the motion artefacts are
cancelled in the detrusor pressure. However there is no sign of
the longer lasting phasic contraction associated with instability</strong></font></p>

        immediately obvious why this group should occur because
        ambulatory allows a wider range of exercises. However
        ambulatory patients are sent off to perform the exercises
        themselves and it possible some are not pushing

studies have proved useful is in the diagnosis of giggle

has been very difficult to demonstrate because of the infrequency
