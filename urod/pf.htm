<h1><font face="Arial"><strong>The Pressure Flow Study</strong></font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>This is the definitive way to
diagnose bladder outlet obstruction.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>There are 3 principal problems
which can arise with the process of micturition.</strong></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>The urethra becomes obstructed
        usually due to hyperplasia of the prostate</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>The detrusor-sphincter
        co-ordination is lost. This is called detrusor-sphincter
        dyssynergia.</strong></font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Underactive detrusor muscle.</strong></font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>As mentioned previously the </strong></font><a
href="neuro.htm"><font face="Arial"><strong>micturition reflex</strong></font></a><font
face="Arial"><strong> initiates a contraction of the detrusor and
a relaxing of the urethra. Because the urethra is highly
distensible this enables a large flow for little rise in pressure
in the normal case. The obstructed bladder leads directly to high
pressure emptying. This derives from the </strong></font><a
href="uth.htm#bor"><font face="Arial"><strong>bladder output
relation</strong></font></a><font face="Arial"><strong>. The
obstructed urethra requires a very high detrusor pressure to
initiate flow. This gradually decreases and the characteristic D
shape is seen.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The high pressure detrusor in
obstruction has been responsible for some misunderstanding among
clinicians. It was first thought to be &quot;compensation&quot;
by the detrusor whereby it hypertrophied in order to create these
high pressures. However this concept is now discredited. Any
normal detrusor would produce high pressures in the presence of
obstruction. This is a result of the bladder output relation
which derives from simple physiological measurements on bladder
strips and geometry..</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>All of the above 3 abnormalities
can be investigated by the pressure-flow study. Detrusor pressure
and flow rate are measured simultaneously - often with a
suprapubic catheter so that there is no obstruction to the flow
as there would be with urethral catheterisation. For diagnostic
purposes, the most informative way to present the data from a
pressure flow study is to plot pressure against flow.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The seminal work on </strong></font><a
href="uth.htm"><font face="Arial"><strong>the dynamics of
micturition</strong></font></a><font face="Arial"><strong> has
been done by </strong></font><a href="bib.htm#abgr"><font
face="Arial"><strong>Derek Griffiths and Paul Abrams </strong></font></a><font
face="Arial"><strong>(1979) whose papaer is used extensively to
diagnose the obstructed bladder. Abrams and Griffiths studied 117
men who had been referred for investigation of possible
obstruction. These men were classified clinically and then the
Abrams Griffiths nomogram (the red quadrilateral on the plots)
was devised as the best method for separating the pressure flow
loops. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Although theoretical models of
normal micturition have been evaluated (Griffiths &amp; Rollema
1979 Med &amp; Biol Eng and Comp 17 291-300) it is the abnormal
micturition and in particular the obstructed urethra which is
most commonly studied.</strong></font></p>

characteristic patterns of pressure flow loops.</strong></font></p>
