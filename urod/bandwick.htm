<H2>Checking the catheter response for the method of Brown and Wickham</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="bandwick.gif" width ="450" height = "300">
<P>Occluding the measuring holes of the catheter produces a sharp
pressure rise. The gradient of the rise tells whether the combined
measuring system has a sharp enough response for urethral pressure
profile measurement. In this case the gradient is 31.6 cm water per second. Brown and Wickham
specify that a figure of 200 cm H2O per second is adequate at a profile withdrawal rate of 
1 cm per second. Therefore with this combination of catheter and connecting tube, the 
withdrawal rate needs to be one sixth of 1 cm per second or just less than 2 mm per second
