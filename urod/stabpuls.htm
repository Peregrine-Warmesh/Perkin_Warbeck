<H2>Normal detrusor function</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="stabpuls.jpg"></P>
<P>The normal detrusor if filled slowly accepts 300 - 600 ml without rise in
pressure. This is because the passive detrusor is viscoelastic. In this 
trace there is normal detrusor function. There are a few artefacts in the abdominal pressure which are completely cancelled in the detrusor trace. </p> </html>
