<p>Detrusor Activity :</p>
<ul>
<li>Detrusor may be</li>
<li><u>Normal/Stable</u></li>
<li><u>Overactive</u></li>
<li>The unstable detrusor is one that is shown to contract spontaneously or on provocation during the filling phase while the patient is attempting to inhibit micturition.</li>
<li><u>Hyperreflexic</u></li>
<li>Hyperreflexia is defined as overactivity due to disturbance of the nervous control mechanism. Should only be used where there is objective evidence of neurological disorder.</li>
</ul>

<dt><b>Sensation</b>

<p>Sensation may be</p>
<h6>Normal</h6>
<h6>Hypersensitive</h6>
<h6>Hyposensitive</h6>
<h6>Absent</h6>

<dt><b>Compliance</b>
</dl>
<p></p>
<p>Compliance is defined as DV/DP. It is has an instantaneous value - the inverse of the tangent to the cystometry curve and also depends on filling rate. One does not make statements of the form "the detrusor compliance was  10ml per cm water" In practice

<h6>Low</h6>
<h6>Normal</h6>
<h6>High</h6>
<h6>Equivocal</h6>
<p></p>
<p>NBThe physiologically filled detrusor is always high compliance. The rise in pressure that causes lower compliances is a function of the viscoelastic nature of the detrusor under higher filling rates. i.e. stretch the muscle too fast and it cannot accom

<h2>Voiding studies assess detrusor contractility and urethral obstruction</h2>
<p>The detrusor may be</p>
<h6>acontractile</h6>
<ul>
<li>one that cannot be demonstrated to contract during urodynamics.</li>
</ul>
<h6>areflexic</h6>
<ul>
<li>acontractility due to an abnormality of nervous control</li>
</ul>
<h6>underactive</h6>
<ul>
<li>a detrusor contraction of inadequate magnitude and/or duration to effect bladder emptying</li>
</ul>
<h6>normal</h6>
<ul>
<li>voluntarily initiated contraction that is sustained and can usually be suppressed voluntarily</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The Urethra may be</p>
<h6>normal</h6>
<h6>obstructive</h6>
- mechanical
- stricture
- bladder outlet obstruction
<p></p>
<h4>- overactive</h4>
- detrusor/bladder neck dyssynergia
- detrusor/ (external) sphincter dyssynergia
- typically need radiology to support diagnosis of dyssynergia
