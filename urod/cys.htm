<h2>
<b><font face="Arial">Clinical Introduction</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial">Cystometry is carried out to categorise the bladder.
The main issue is the stability of the detrusor. The normal bladder should
be stable under all conditions of filling or stress. The compliance of
the bladder (</font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">Vol
/ </font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">P) is also of interest
as is its capacity and the patient's sensations of strength of desire to
void. Two pressure Channels are typically measured, rectal pressure and
bladder(intravesical). The rectal pressure responds to any changes of the
abdominal cavity due to straining or stress. These can then be subtracted
from the intravesical to give the true intrinsic bladder pressure from
the detrusor muscle (detrusor pressure).</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial">Quality control is important during cystometry.
The cancellation from the rectal catheter must be accurate.</font></b>

with rectal pulsation, causing negative excursions in the detrusor pressure.
The traces are from top to bottom rectal (abdominal) pressure, Intravesical
pressure, detrusor pressure, and infused volume. The experienced observer
immediately checks the flat intravesical pressure and eliminates the possibility
of unstable bladder.</font></b></td>

<td><b><font face="Arial">The diagram shows an unstable bladder with low
capacity. In such a case the height of the contractions are of interest
as they may exceed the maximum urethral pressure leading to incontinence.
The unstable bladder is a sign that the micturition reflex is triggered
and the reflex lowers urethral pressure. For leakage to take place the
detrusor pressure just has to exceed this lowered urethral pressure. The
patient in the diagram had a static urethral pressure of 100 cm water when
the bladder was stable. The contraction has almost reached this height,
so leakage had almost certainly taken place. Patients with unstable bladders
may also carry the risk of urine refluxing up the ureters causing kidney
damage. This would be tested for by x ray contrast cystometry. Although
a large pressure rise has taken place, this type of bladder would not be
termed low compliance. This term is reserved for the stable bladder with
a large pressure rise.</font></b></td>

<td><b><font face="Arial">An example of a low compliance bladder is shown.
Note how the pressure drops after filling is stopped. This is termed accommodation.
This type of behaviour is a consequence of the viscoelastic nature of the
bladder. It has been observed for years using standard urodynamics techniques
and much debate has been had over what it means. Some would assert that
the low compliance bladder is unstable. In <u><font color="#0000FF"><a href="amb.htm">ambulatory
urodynamics</a></font></u></font></b> <b><font face="Arial">filling rates
are physiological i.e. a few ml per minute instead of a few tens of ml.
Bladders are never found to be low compliance with ambulatory urodynamics.
Low compliance behaviour is a consequence of filling the bladder faster
than it can accommodate. At present work still needs to be done into this
phenomenon.</font></b></td>

<h3>
<b><font face="Arial">Pressure measurements in the Bladder and Urethra</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial">Pressure is measured with <u><font color="#0000FF"><a href="ptrans.htm">strain
gauge transducers</a></font></u>. In these the pressure sensitive elements
form the arms of a Wheatstone bridge. Pressure raises the resistance of
one arm and lowers the resistance of the other.</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">The pressure is typically conveyed to the sensors
via fluid filled lines.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial">These lines will damp the pressure waveform, removing
high frequencies.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial">In diagnostic cystometry, the characteristic pressures
of interest - e.g. detrusor instability are low frequency.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial">Some damping from the lines is acceptable.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial">The transducers can be zeroed to atmospheric pressure
by balancing the bridge.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial">For most urodynamic measurements a sampling rate
of 30 Hz is more than adequate. Although the transducer will satisfy this,
care must be taken interpreting results from a fluid filled system as air
in the lines can cause damping which is unacceptable. In cases where fast
frequency response is required, catheter tip transducers are used - see
<u><font color="#0000FF"><a href="amb.htm">ambulatory
urodynamics</a></font></u>.</font></b></li>
