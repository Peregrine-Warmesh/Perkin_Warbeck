Divisions into internal and external sphincter are functional rather than
anatomic. The antomy is still debatable.Note the male has a much higher urethral
pressure and also a contribution from the prostate. hence the voluntary muscles
of the levator ani (pelvic floor) are more crucial in providing continence in
the female especially if the urethra has been moved outside the abdominal cavity
by childbirth.</TD></TR></TABLE><BR><HR><A HREF="clinical.htm">BACK</A></BODY></HTML>
