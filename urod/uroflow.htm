<h1><font face="Arial"><strong>Uroflowmetry</strong></font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>In clinical practice Uroflowmetry
(simple plotting of flow rate with time) has been found to offer
reasonable sensitivity and specificity if carried out correctly. <br>
Much of this work has been pioneered by Rollema ( Rollema HJ .PhD
thesis University of Groningen 1981); he found that best results
were gained from analysing an indirect time parameter related to
how long the flow took to fall from its maximum to the point
where 90% had been voided. However most flowmeters can not
analyse the data in this way - apart from the commercial one with
whom Rollema has links -but print certain standard variables.
Among these is the maximum flow rate in ml per sec Q</strong><code><strong>max</strong></code><strong>
.</strong></font></p>

        shape of the curve is unimodal i.e. monotonic increase,
        stable period,monotonic decrease. There are no artefacts
        from abdominal straining or &quot;waggling&quot; of the
        stream. Q</strong><sub><strong>max</strong></sub><strong>
        is 19 in the first and 23 in the second. Since Q</strong><sub><strong>max</strong></sub><strong>
        is found to depend on volume this is not surprising.</strong></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Some poor flows from an obstructed
patient are shown below.</strong></font></p>

        There are no artefacts from abdominal straining or

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Although the above are very poor
flows, there is a significant probability that they are a result
of a poorly contracting bladder rather than and obstructed one.An
example of such a cse can be seen in the </strong></font><a

face="Arial"><strong> section.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Rollema found that Q</strong><sub><strong>max</strong></sub><strong>
could be used to give sensitivity and specificity of 90 %. These
figures are definitely an upper limit - other investigators have
not claimed such high values, particularly for sensitivity.
Still, Uroflowmetry is an easy non invasive test, but of course
care must be taken to use it in the correct patient group. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Like many clinical tests the value
of Uroflowmetry depends very much on its positive predictive
value.<br>
<br>
</strong><strong><i>The positive predictive value of a test is
the percentage of patients with a positive test who are correctly
diagnosed.</i></strong><strong><br>
<br>
</strong><strong><i>The negative predictive value of a test is
the percentage of patients with a negative test who are correctly
diagnosed. <br>
.</i></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The table shows the PPV of
uroflowmetry using Rollema's best estimate for 3 prevalences</strong></font></p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>Prevalence</strong></font></td>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>PPV</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>50 %</strong></font></td>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>90%</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>25%</strong></font></td>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>70%</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>10%</strong></font></td>
        <td><font face="Arial"><strong>50%</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Clearly then Uroflowmtery can not
be used to screen a low prevalance population.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>In the case of </strong></font><a
href="boo.htm"><font face="Arial"><strong>benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH)</strong></font></a><font face="Arial"><strong>,
the prevalence of clinical disease ranges from about 10 % at age
50 to 35% at age 70. It is therefore important to select the
correct patients for uroflowmetry. Symptoms, history, and other
tests e.g. digital examination will aid the selection.</strong></font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>Flow Instrumentation</strong></font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>An array of techniques has been
used to measure urine flow rate. Many depend on the recording of
the volume of urine passed with the derivative being flow rate.
For example the gravimetric method - passing the urine into a
container which is continuously weighed. Most of these techniques
suffer from the amount of processing that is required to
eliminate artefacts from vibration or movement. Worth mention is
the drop spectrometer, where it was noted from high speed
photography that shortly after leaving the external meatus the
urinary stream is broken up into drops. By an ingenious set of
light beams and photomultipliers it is possible to measure flow
rate with a very short time constant.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>In this department the flowmeter
favoured at present is the rotating disk mictiometer made by
Dantec. Here the urine is directed onto a spinning disk whose
rotational velocity is kept constant by a tachometer and feedback
circuit. As fluid hits the disk, more electrical energy is
required to maintain the constant angular velocity and
measurement of the extra current can be used to give flow rate.
Patients have to be carefully warned not to waggle the stream
when voiding as this can produce artefacts. Imagine a man moves
the stream from high up the funnel to low down and back up again.
A bolus will arrive at the instrumentation and then there will be
a gap.</strong></font></p>
