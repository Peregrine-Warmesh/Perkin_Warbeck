<td><b><font face="Arial">The normal detrusor can accept 300 - 600 ml without
rise in detrusor presure. In this case there is a marked rise in pressure
and the bladder is said to accommodate (pressure decays again) when filling
is stopped.&nbsp;</font></b>

It is has an instantaneous value - the inverse of the tangent to the cystometry
curve and also depends on filling rate. One does not make statements of
the form "the detrusor compliance was 10ml per cm water" In practice detrusor
compliance is usually defined in words (low or high) rather than numbers.&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The meaning of low compliance is a subject
of much debate in the urodynamics community. Many spinal injury bladders
demonstrate low compliance. The example shown in NOT spinal injury. This
patient had detrusor instability at ambulatory studies</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial">NB. The physiologically filled detrusor is always
high compliance. The rise in pressure that causes lower compliances is
a function of the viscoelastic nature of the detrusor under higher filling
rates. i.e. stretch the muscle too fast and it cannot accommodate completely.</font></b></td>
