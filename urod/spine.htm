<h1><font face="Arial"><strong>Urodynamics in the spinal injury</strong></font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The management of the lower urinary
tract is of vital importance in spinal injury. Until fairly
recently kidney failure was the biggest late killerof spinally
injured patients. The reason for this is that in the absence of
intact neurology the bladder can become</strong></font><a

face="Arial"><strong> generating very high detrsuor pressures,
reflux and thus hydronephrosis.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The type of bladder depends on the
level and the complenessof the spinal lesion.</strong></font></p>
