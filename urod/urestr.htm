<TD><H3 ALIGN=left>The urethra under stress.</H3> A transient increase in abdominal pressure should
be communicated equally to the bladder and urethra.  However if the urethra has
been moved outside the abdominal cavity by childbirth its ability to respond may
well be diminished. A negative closure pressure can then be created and the
potential for stress incontinence exists. Hence the voluntary muscles of the
levator ani (pelvic floor) are more crucial in providing continence in the
female.</TD></TR></TABLE><BR><HR><A HREF="clinical.htm">BACK</A></BODY></HTML>
