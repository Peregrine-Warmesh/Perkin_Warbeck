<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Experiments with strips of pig bladder have yielded 
the dependence of force upon extension. It might be thought as a result of the 
shape of these curves that detrusor pressure would rise in a similar way with 
volume</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>however from the diagram below the Laplace equation 
is derived. It gives the balance of forces. takes geometry into account and 
because r squared is on the right hand side, detrusor pressure does not in fact 
rise particularly quickly with volume.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=240 src="laplace.gif" width=360></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Thus we find that</STRONG></FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>In a stable bladder at physiological filling 
  rates (&lt;20 ml min) detrusor pressure rises very little </STRONG></FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>With fast filling rates of the order of 100 ml 
  min -1 the detrusor pressure often rises to a few tens of cm water and this 
  pressure decays after filling has ceased. This decay is termed 
  accommodation.</STRONG></FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Fast ( i.e. non-physiological) filling rates have 
always been used for the past 20 years as a convenience to make investigations 
possible in a reasonable time. With the recent development of ambulatory 
urodynamics the bladder is filled naturally and observation 1 has been quite 
convincingly confirmed.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The behaviour described in the second observation is 
consistent with a viscoelastic model. A theoretical model for the detrusor has 
been developed by Coolaset whereby the passive detrusor is modeled by 3 
non-linear elastic elements E1-E3 in series with 3 dashpots h1- h3 3. These are 
in parallel with E</STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Courier New" 
size=2><STRONG>0</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><STRONG> which gives the static 
time - independent behaviour.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=180 src="detmod.gif" width=270></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The pressure rise at fast filling can be marked - as 
much as 50 cm H</STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Courier New" 
size=2><STRONG>2</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>O. This is termed a low 
compliance bladder - compliance is the change in volume divided by the change in 
pressure. In </STRONG></FONT><A

face=Arial><STRONG> when the flow rate is by renal excretion these pressure 
rises are not present .</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>All of the above refers only to the stable bladder. 
One of the main reasons to perform urodynamics is to test for the unstable 
bladder (detrusor instability). This is a bladder which has involuntary phasic 
contraction.<BR></STRONG></FONT><A name=inst_htm><IMG height=120 
src="cysinsth.gif" width=180></A><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>As mentioned 
previously the bladder may contract involuntarily if the spinal cord is not 
intact, but Detrusor instability can also occur with no neurological pathology. 
These contractions can be as large as 200 cm H</STRONG></FONT><FONT 
face="Courier New" size=2><STRONG>2</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>O 
and can cause leakage of urine. They can also have disastrous social 
implications as the patient may have a urinary frequency of many more than once 
per hour day and night. Also they carry the risk of ureteric reflux which can 
lead to hydronephrosis ( destruction of kidney)</STRONG></FONT></P>
<H2><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Emptying</STRONG></FONT></H2>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Contractile behaviour of Detrusor muscle 
strips.</STRONG></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>During emptying of the bladder (micturition) there 
is an active contraction of the detrusor. When a muscle contracts actively its 
mechanical properties undergo a functional change and become quite different 
from those of the same muscle at rest. The behaviour of striated muscle has been 
studied extensively. It is often described in terms of a model consisting of 3 
elements, </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><IMG height=180 src="ce.gif" width=270></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>which represent mathematical concepts rather than 
discrete structures in the muscle.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The contractile element CE is responsible for the 
functional change. It is under nervous control. At rest it exerts no tension. 
When stimulated to contract it develops a tension which depends on the speed of 
shortening as well as the stimulation and the extension. The active tension 
exerted at zero speed of shortening is called the isometric tension. As speed 
increases the tension decreases in a characteristic way, </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The parallel elastic element PE exerts a tension 
non-linearly dependent on its extension. The total tension in the muscle is the 
sum of the contributions from PE and CE. At rest, only the contribution from PE 
remains. The PE represents the passive mechanical properties of the muscle. The 
SE is a second non-linear elastic element in series with the CE. Its tension is 
always equal to the active tension in CE. Whenever the active tension is altered 
the length of SE alters with the result that sudden changes are smoothed out. 
But the detrusor is </STRONG><STRONG><I>smooth</I></STRONG><STRONG> muscle. The 
mechanical properties of smooth muscle are less well known. One might hope to 
represent it with the figure above with PE replaced by the viscoelastic 
properties discussed in the previous section. Fortunately during micturition the 
passive contribution to the tension is considerably smaller than the active so 
only CE and SE need be considered. The behaviour of the CE under given 
stimulation is described by the dependence of the tension F on the extension and 
speed of shortening </STRONG><STRONG><I>u</I></STRONG><STRONG>. The extension 
dependence is completely defined by the relation between F</STRONG></FONT><FONT 
face="Courier New" size=2><STRONG>iso</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><STRONG> 
and extension. The velocity dependence is described by the relation between F/ 
F</STRONG></FONT><FONT face="Courier New" 
size=2><STRONG>iso</STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial><STRONG> and u which follows 
approximately the equation for striated muscle (work done by Hill in

<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The relation predicts that at a given bladder volume 
the pressure generated by the detrusor depends on the flow rate out of the 
bladder. It is volume dependent because both P</STRONG></FONT><FONT 
face="Courier New" size=2><STRONG>det,iso</STRONG></FONT><FONT 
face=Arial><STRONG> and Q* are. It is an automatic geometrical consequence of 
the well known relation between force and speed of shortening from muscles. It 
has a crucial role to play in our understanding of micturition. It tells us that 
in the presence of obstruction leading to low flow, the normal detrusor will 
void at high pressure. In the past, the measured high pressures in obstructed 
patients were erroneously ascribed to detrusor compensation; a belief that as 
the detrusor was having to work harder to empty it developed greater contractile 
strength leading to higher pressure. In fact, the obstructed detrusor tends to 
hypertrophy and has lower strength as the obstruction persists. In confirmation 
of our hypothesis, experiments have been performed whereby the urethra is 
instantly obstructed by a constriction, with the detrusor moving instantly to a 
high pressure low flow pattern. Thus the way is paved to solve a difficult 
diagnostic problem. Older men may present with poor flow and a history typical 
of prostatic obstruction. Resection of the prostate on symptoms alone however, 
may be unhelpful in 25 %. These have an underactive detrusor. Simultaneous 
detrusor pressure and flow measurement will discriminate.</STRONG></FONT></P>

in its hydrodynamic behaviour. A simplified equation relating detrusor pressure 
and flow for the normal urethra is</STRONG></FONT></P>
