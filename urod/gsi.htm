<H1>Genuine Stress Incontinence</H1>

<P>Ambulatory trace over 2 minutes.There is leakage of about 20 ml in one
epsiodes.The bladder is stable and there is a lot of movement.The patient is
bending down and up again.Because the bladder is stable we can make the
diagnosis Genuine stress incontinence.</P>
The ICS definitions may lag slightly behind current opinion. For example Ed McGuire of the Universtiy of Texas has made a significant contribution to the understanding of Genuine stress incontinence. He has defined 3 types of incontinence. These require urethral pressure measuremtns and x-ray visualisiation of the bladder neck under stress.<BR><BR>
