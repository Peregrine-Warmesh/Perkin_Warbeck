Cockburn</a> my long term hero played the Old Fruitmarket Glasgow. I have
seen him many times, about seven in all, but a visit to your home town
is always exciting.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The man was fantastic. How he makes that
one guitar make all that heavenly sound is beyond me. According to a recent
Canadian TV program it is also beyond Jackson Browne. Ricky had pulled
a few strings and we ended up backstage. I will never be too cool to ask
for a photo and here it is.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">A Cockburn gig always seems to have a
request for the most obscure song out of the back catalogue and this was
no exception. Someone shouted "why don't we celebrate" "Aren't we?" responded
Bruce. I was the wag who shouted for "<a href="http://cockburnproject.net/songs&music/nj.html">Nanzen

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The gig annoncement had originally been
met with some trepidation on my part due to bad passive smoking experiences
at that venue in the past.But the Council have finally got their act together
and after a reassuring letter from Bridget McConnell, Director of Culture
and Leisure, I went fully vibed up. <a href="http://www.rockulike.demon.co.uk">Ricky</a>,
<a href="http://www.sghurol.demon.co.uk/shankers/">Swan</a>,
<a href="../../../smcl/index.htm">Sheila</a> and myself had a little drink
over the road and then trooped over. One foot inside the door a security
man warned us "it's no smoking now folks". Result.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It may seem pedantic to go on about this,
but the number of favourite acts I have missed due to smoky venues is now
quite large. Most recently Roger McGuinn had to be body swerved. At least
the Fruitmarket is now a goer.</font></b>
