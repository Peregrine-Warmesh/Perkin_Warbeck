out it's just Roddy (Christopher Chung), hanging out in a fast-food
chicken restaurant by himself. He finally manages to get hold of
Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar) and asks her why no one has shown up for
their Christmas party? They don't have a Christmas party, she tells
him. It takes Roddy a minute, but he finally figures Lamb was playing
a trick on him. So he heads out of the restaurant onto the crowded

massive explosion that goes off behind him.</font></font></p>

explosion was caused by a car bomb at the Westacres shopping center.
Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) arrives on the scene, but she's not
alone. She is joined by the new First Desk, Claude Whelan (James
Callis). Whelan is nearly in shock from the scene, while Taverner is
all business, asking for everything they know.<br/>
The bomber was a
28-year-old IT consultant named Robert Winters with no clear
background as to why he'd do this. With the address he gave the car
rental company being a fake, Taverner believes Winters is an alias as
well. Whelan asks if it could be a one-off? Either that or the start
of something, Taverner says.</span></span></span></font></span></font></font></p>

and Louisa have that same conversation the next day at a pub until
River needs to get something off his chest. He stumbles about how
close he's felt with Louisa, making her nervous he is going to ask
her out. She nixes that before he gets too far, but to her
embarrassment that's not what River is talking about. He reveals his
grandfather, David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce), is losing his mental
facilities. The last time River saw him it took David 10 minutes to
remember River. What should he do? She tells him the only thing he
can do is to take care of him, starting with going to see him that
night.</font></font></p>

may be right about his grandfather. We see David walking alone back
to his house, but he looks very concerned. He believes someone is
watching him, yelling at them to reveal themselves, but from what we
can tell there is no one there.</font></font></p>

<font color="#333333"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
won't take any chances though. He grabs a shotgun, closes the blinds
and waits for any intruders to come. David eventually falls asleep,
until he's woken by a knock at the door. David sees it's River
(though we never see his face), who goes immediately to the bathroom
as he enters.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">David
can't shake the feeling something isn't right though. So he grabs the
shotgun again and carefully heads upstairs. He enters the bathroom
with the gun barrel at the ready, saying this man is not his
grandson, despite protests. David pulls the trigger, killing River.
Coming to, David asks himself what he has done.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lamb
is woken up by his phone. He's being called to David's house by Emma
Flyte (Ruth Bradley), Duffy's replacement as head of the Dogs. After
Lamb introduces himself in his own special way, they get down to the
business at hand.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Showing
Lamb the scene, Emma explains David pushed his panic button at 9:03
pm, but the police didn't arrive until 9:49 (they apparently have
been called needlessly by David before because of his forgetfulness).
Despite finding River's phone and wallet at the scene, Emma wants
Lamb to ID River's body, which is tricky because in addition to the
chest wound he was also shot in the face. Lamb makes a few jokes,
which raises Emma's suspicion about why he doesn't seem concerned.
But he assures her he's lost agents before and he's certainly not
River's biggest fan. Ultimately, he identifies the body as River.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lamb
now has a question: where's David? But Emma doesn't know. She asks if

are a number of new members at the Park and Slough House we meet in
this episode. We already discussed Flyte and Whelan, but while the
former seems quite competent (though we learn she was an outside hire
suggested by Whelan), we might want to be worried about the new First
Desk. He does not seem to know what he is doing, asking Taverner to
give him an idea of what to expect in a big meeting and then just
asking her to handle it and report back to him.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Over
at Slough House, we meet Moira Tregorian (Joanna Scanlan), who is
Standish's replacement as office manager, as she walks in on Marcus
and Shirley (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) betting on how long Shirley can
withstand waterboarding (with paperclips as the currency, as Marcus
is trying to handle his gambling addiction). Then there's JK Cole

video of Robert Winters shows the bomber saying, &quot;You have
crushed me. Reapped violence upon me. Only now will I be free. You
will suffer for the years I spent imprisoned by your system. God
willing I will not be the last. You will hear from my brothers soon.&quot;
This plays as a specialist unit prepares to check Winters' apartment.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After
getting an update from Flyte on the Cartwright situation and telling
her to keep on it, Taverner oversees the operation, with Whelan again
deferring to her. Breaking down the door, the specialists don't find
anyone or anything and hand the scene over to forensics. However,
someone opens up the window blinds, which pulls the pins on a number
of grenades, causing a big explosion and killing multiple people.
Taverner not only has to deal with this mess, but council an
ashen-faced Whelan on his duties (notifying the families).</font></font></p>

him what is going on, he dryly says River is dead. They all think
it's a sick joke, but Roddy shows them a text that Lamb sent saying
he ID'd River's body; Marcus also finds a report confirming a body
was found at David's. Louisa is devastated, blaming herself and

Roddy just got a text, Lamb decides to personally tell Standish

that she no longer works for him, Lamb slinks in anyway and informs
her River is dead. However, when she doesn't ask for details, Lamb
tries to coax her to admit she knows River is still alive. She denies
it, but bluffing was never her strong suit; River’s car is outside.
Standish finally admits River was there, but he isn't now. Lamb isn't
satisfied. He makes his way into the bedroom to find a sleeping
David. Lamb wakes him up and asks where River is.</font></font></p>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">David
explains he thought it was River initially, but when he called him
&quot;gramps&quot; he got suspicious. When the imposter lunged at
him, David shot him. It's a good thing he did, because River finds
drugs on the body, figuring they were going to knock David out and
kill him. River also finds a return train ticket to France, a receipt
from a cafe called Le Blanc Russe in Lavande and a passport with the
name Adam Lockhead.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">All
of this flusters David, so he hits his panic button, which puts them
on the clock. If David talks to the police, River worries he'll be
taken away. David has an outburst, yelling at River not to speak to
him that way because he's his father. That slip-up convinces David
that River is right. River says they need to get somewhere safe, but
first, he leaves behind his phone and wallet to make it look like
it's really him, then shoots the imposter in the face to obscure the
body (promptly puking after seeing the result).</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#333333"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">At
the Park, Giti Rahman (Kiran Sonia Sawar) reports to Taverner
(Kristin Scott Thomas) that Robert Winters' passport appears to have
been issued by the agency 28 years ago; was Winters one of their
agents? After confirming this was brought straight to her, Taverner
arranges for Flyte (Ruth Bradley) to take Giti to a safe location so
they can dig up everything they need to on Winters (in reality
isolate her).<br/>
</span></span></span></font></span>Lamb (Gary
Oldman) is also trying to comb through the past. Once Standish
(Saskia Reeves) confirms River is headed to France, the Slough House
head tries to get some answers out of David. But David is confused,
and despite Lamb thinking it's all an act, he isn't able to get a
clear answer out of him. He'll have to find out what the connection
is between David and France on his own.</font></font></p>

arrives in Lavande, but the town is practically deserted. He is able
to find Le Blanc Russe, where he asks the bartender if someone who
looked like him came in a few days ago. The bartender says yes,
telling River the man lived just a little bit out of town in a place
called Les Arbres.</font></font></p>

<font color="#333333"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Despite
their different styles, Lamb and Taverner have always been two pros
of the spy game. We're reminded of both of those things in this
episode.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">With
Taverner, she patiently sits as Whelan (James Callis) talks about how
the Park needs to be more transparent and install a culture change.
Taverner dances around whether or not she agrees with him, noting
they are at a heightened threat level at the moment. She does have
some housekeeping for him though, having him sign condolence letters
for the agents who died in the apartment bombing.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Later,
Taverner checks in on Giti, telling her there must have been a
glitch: the Park created a fake ID for Robert Winter, not Robert
Winters, 30 years ago, telling her the bomber has nothing to do with
the Park. However, as she tells Giti this, she is destroying all
evidence related to the ID in the archive.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><br/>
Taverner
then has another meeting with Whelan, this time on a bus, away from
the eyes and ears of the Park. She tells him Robert Winters was
actually the Park's fake ID (or cold body, as she puts it), but she's
deleted all records of him. Whelan is upset she didn't tell him
sooner so he could take it to the Prime Minister and begin an
inquiry. That's exactly why she didn't tell him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
Whelan insists they divulge this, Taverner pulls out a trump card:
Whelan authorized the sequestering of Giti (the documents she said
were condolence letters). Whelan didn't read the document, but he's
now complicit in the act. Whelan thinks Taverner is doing this out of
revenge for him getting First Desk. She rebuts she didn't apply for
the job, yet she is still doing the key bits, pointing out the job
isn't &quot;big picture,&quot; as he puts it, it's putting out fires
every day.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
Slough House, Lamb chastises Roddy (Christopher Chung) for stealing
River's computer, telling him River isn't dead. The whole team is
confused. Only JK (Tom Brooke), saying something for the first time,
realizes Lamb never said River was dead. As to why he strung them
along, and devastated Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar), Lamb says River is a
Joe in the field, and you never blow a Joe's cover (he particularly
emphasizes this for JK). Louisa asks how they can help River?
Nothing, Lamb says, just let him retrace the assassin's steps in
France. &quot;France is big,&quot; Marcus (Kadiff Kirwan) astutely
points out.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
Lamb and Taverner aren't the only spies doing their job. A delivery
guy (Tom Woznickza) with a French accent arrives at the Cartwright
house. He asks the police what happened? They let slip a young man
died. As he leaves, the Frenchman discreetly places a camera in the
stonewall. Once in the car he calls someone, a bearded man whose face
we don't see, and tells him David is still alive and either River or
Bertrand (the imposter) was killed instead. The bearded man knows
that Betrand's passport was used to get into the country, so he'll
wait to see who shows up, but the Frenchman should get to his next
target: an old employee of David's (Lamb?).</font></font></p>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A
few Slough House things to note in this episode. Shirley spots Marcus
has a gun in his bag, somehow inferring this means he's gambling
again. Marcus eventually admits he's planning to sell the gun on the
street to get money for a bet on a sure thing, then pay his debts and
buy the gun back before anyone can do something bad with it. Noting
the desperate nature of this, Shirley says Marcus should have come to
her as a friend. Though, can she give him £10,000 to keep him from
losing his house and wife?</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Elsewhere,
Lamb finally meets Moira (Joanna Scanlan), who has cleaned Lamb's
office (much to his dismay). He takes her to lunch where he pokes a
hole in her sunny disposition about being at Slough House by
reminding her only two types of people end up there: screw-ups and
those that have pissed someone off. He doesn't think she is a
screw-up, so he offers her a deal: use her connections still at the
Park to get info on when and why David was ever in France during his
career and he'll get her back to the Park. She agrees.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">River
arrives at Les Arbres, an abandoned-looking estate with weaponry and
bullet casings lying about in the yard. When River feels the kettle
is still warm in the house, he realizes he is not alone. He searches
the house, taking a special note of a mural of a valley and animals
before eventually finding a picture of a group of men, one of which
is Robert Winters.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">River
then realizes a fire has started downstairs. As he tries to make his
way out he is hit in the back of the head by the bearded man (played
by Hugo Weaving). They fight, but the bearded man is scared off when
the Frenchmen that was tracking River comes in with a shotgun. He
grabs River, takes him out of the house and puts him in a van. River
tries to thank him, but is quickly knocked out with the butt of the
shotgun and driven off the property to who knows where.</font></font></p>

he isn't cuffed, River is locked in the room. He hears footsteps
coming up the stairs, so he grabs a pot to defend himself. But he's
immediately outmatched when the man who kidnapped him (Eric Savin)
bursts in with a shotgun. River doesn't fight, he just wants to know
what's going on. All the man tells him is that someone is coming to
talk to him.</font></font></p>

David
Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce) is still struggling to get a grip on
what's going on. At Standish's (Saskia Reeves), he talks about River
and the bomber before insisting he speak with First Desk to warn them
about what's coming. Standish calms him by saying First Desk is busy
reading wires from Berlin, as if it's still the Cold War, but
promising to set up an appointment. This works, but David still
rambles on, saying it's all his fault.</font></font></p>

with Emma in his office, Lamb correctly guesses they finally pieced
together the dead body isn't River. He deflects blame saying River is
his agent, and since he clearly wanted to be thought of as dead, Lamb
was going to keep it that way as long as he could. Emma handcuffs
Lamb for obstructing the investigation and plans to take him to the
Park. Guessing he's a sacrificial lamb (no pun intended) to Taverner
after Emma screwed up the River situation, he offers an alternative:
telling her where David is. When Emma asks why he would do this, Lamb
says, &quot;Because going to the Park is like being in IKEA, you can
never get out of the f***ing place.&quot; Emma agrees.</font></font></p>

As
River watches more people gather outside the building, a woman
(Coralie Audret) enters the house. She and River's kidnapper come
back in, wanting to know who River is and why he has Bertrand's

with the intent to kill him, but David shot him instead.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">It
turns out the woman is Natasha, Bertrand's mother, while the man is
Victor, Bertrand's uncle. They tell River to leave, but with the
growing mob outside seemingly waiting for him (they think he is
Bertrand), River reveals he is MI5 and shows the picture he found at
the chateau. He wants to know about the man Bertrand is with in the
picture, saying he is responsible for the Westacre bombing and he
needs to find him before another bomb goes off.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Natasha
explains the older man is Frank Harkness (Hugo Weaving). He had sons
with multiple women from different countries. River asks if Natasha
painted the mural he found, but she says no, one of the other women
did. As they talk, even more people gather outside with the mob.
Natasha explains the leader of the mob's daughter was assaulted and
put in the hospital by Bertrand. Victor tries to go explain the
situation so River can leave, but he is quickly knocked out and the
mob attempts to break into the house.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">River
races through the house and is able to escape through the bathroom

Slough House.</font></font></p>

4 with a quick recap of everything that's going on. They determine
the man who's after Sam Chapman (Sean Gilder) is a pro, but Chapman
doesn't recognize him. When Lamb asks him about Lavande, it clicks
for Chapman: this is all about Les Arbres, which houses a team of
professional killers. He doesn't want to be debriefed at the Park
though, worried they'll lock him up for whatever he did, so instead
they take him to Slough House.<br/>
Speaking of those professional
killers, their leader Frank (Hugo Weaving) meets with his employer:
royalty from an unnamed Middle Eastern country who is none too
pleased about how Westacres went down. While Frank admits they messed
up, his employer simply wants to tie off all loose ends rather than
risk the British government finding out about their involvement —
meaning killing Frank. Frank says others are already aware something
is up, but he can kill them to close the loop. His employer gives him
until midnight. So now there is a target and a ticking clock on both
Chapman and David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce).</span></span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

Lamb and Chapman arrive at Slough House, an MI5 car is waiting. Lamb
checks it out, discovering Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas). She's got
a general idea of what has happened but has two questions for Lamb:
why would someone want to kill David now and where is River (Jack
Lowden)? Lamb gives her the bare minimum of information and needles
her when he realizes Flyte (Ruth Bradley) hasn't been keeping her up
to date on everything going on. She tells him to inform her if either
of the Cartwrights shows up.</font></font></p>

Slough House, Standish (Saskia Reeves) is waiting and like everyone
else is confused by JK (Tom Brooke), though she thinks his fidgeting
fingers are his attempt to block something out. She then tells Lamb
that David got out. Since he wanted to speak to First Desk, she sent
Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar) to keep an eye out for him at the Park.
Lamb then tells Standish to join him on the debrief with
Chapman.<br/>
</span></span></span></font></span>Chapman explains he
went to France once for David, taking a car that was packed full of
guns, ammunition, explosives and IDs — MI5's cold bodies. He
brought all this to Les Arbres to exchange for a woman. In a
flashback we see a young Frank, though Chapman doesn't know his name,
only calling him a &quot;scary f***er.&quot; As the young woman is
leaving, Frank whispers something into her ear that we don't hear,
she then slaps him across the face before getting into the car. He
recalls she didn't say a word the whole way back to England, then
gave Chapman the slip as soon as she could. However, what he really
thought was strange was that David didn't seem to care.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">With
this intel and Standish saying David wanted to speak with First Desk,
Lamb pieces together he isn't heading for the Park, but &quot;the old
building,&quot; the previous headquarters of MI5.</font></font></p>

isn't the only one to figure this out. After getting a talking to by
Taverner that if she keeps any more information from her Flyte will
be fired, Flyte gets a call from &quot;the old building.&quot; It has
been converted to a hotel but they are still aware enough to let MI5
know when David shows up asking to speak with First Desk. Flyte tells
the concierge to keep an eye on David until they get there. So it's a
race to the old building as Lamb, Chapman and Standish try to beat
Flyte there (who on the way appears to recognize Louisa standing
outside the Park).</font></font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Meanwhile,
Taverner tells Claude (James Callis) they found David and she'll
debrief him when he gets to the Park. However, Claude has a surprise
for Taverner. He reveals Giti (Kiran Sonia Sawar) got more info on
the cold bodies and found Adam Lockhead, the alias used by River's
doppelganger. He's angry she kept this from him and says they'll have
to have a complete and public investigation into the situation.
Taverner calls him a fool, saying their only priority is to find out
if another bomb is going to go off, opening themselves up to the
public won't do any good. One thing did come of this for MI5 though,
as Giti notifies them that Adam Lockhead's passport is on its way
back to London, meaning River is on his way back. Taverner calls
Flyte and tells her to split her teams to go after both David and
River.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Lamb,
Chapman and Standish arrive first at the old building. Chapman goes
to talk to David while Standish attempts to figure out how to
distract the Dogs on their way; Lamb waits in the getaway car. David
doesn't immediately recognize Chapman, but even when he does he won't
be moved, saying he is waiting for First Desk.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
the Dogs arrive at the hotel, Standish sets off the fire alarm to
cause confusion. It works, as the agents walk right by David and
Chapman to speak with the concierge. However, when the concierge
points out where David was sitting, he and Chapman are gone.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">With
David in the car, Chapman says he is going to break off, grab his
flight fund and head out of the country to avoid prosecution from the
Park. However, he's not out of the woods. We saw earlier Frank meet
with his assassin, Patrice (Tom Woznickza). He also knows where
Chapman stashed his flight fund. He's able to sneak up on Chapman,
beating him to get info on where David is and then presumably
finishing what he failed to do previously and killing him.</font></font></p>

the train arrives, Flyte and her team race to intercept River. Frank

out how the Park is ahead of him, Frank plans to go through the same
channel they used to get David's address originally.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">River
evades Flyte and her men on the train platform, but they eventually
track him down and give chase through the station. River is only able
to elude them when he slips onto a metro car at the last second, with
the door closing on Flyte and the other agents' faces. Still, Flyte
believes she knows where River is going: home.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Home
being David's house, where River is able to sneak in. He finds a box
of pictures in the house, including drawings that are similar to that
of the mural, causing him to say &quot;f**k me.&quot; That same
sentiment can be applied when he hears Flyte and her team arrive at
the house. However, River is able to hide in the attic, seemingly
avoiding them. That is until he drops down and finds Flyte waiting
for him.</font></font></p>

Frank explains Molly would know him as Mitch Philpott,

the car, Emma finds the photo of Frank, Robert Winters and the others
River had. But River reiterates he won't talk until he's spoken to
David. She tries to guilt him with the possibility of another bomb,
but Rivers says Westacres was a one-off (he thinks). Emma finally
relents, promising River five minutes with David, he just needs to
tell her where he is. He says at Standish's (Saskia Reeves). Emma
says Lamb (Gary Oldman) already tried that; he's not there, which of
course is news to River.</span></span></span></font></span></font></font></p>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Emma
calls Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas), saying she has River but he
won't talk until he talks with David. Taverner asks Emma to bring the
Adam Lockhead passport to her. Emma notes she should log it first,
but Taverner demands she skip that and bring her the passport. When
she gets off the phone, it's River who has the questions: where's his
grandfather? Does Lamb have him? Why didn't Emma tell Taverner about
the photograph? Now Emma isn't answering.</font></font></p>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Still
driving around, David tells Lamb and Standish to let him go, that
they work for him. Lamb reminds David that's not the case anymore, so
now he has to listen to his questions: who did David send the guns
and money to in France? David says he doesn't have to answer to Lamb.
Instead, David wants to know where Lamb is taking him. It's not to
the Park or Slough House.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#333333"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Conversely,
Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar), Marcus (Kadiff Kirwan) and Shirley
(Aimee-Ffion Edwards) are on their way back to Slough House. Shirley
is still upset Marcus sold his gun. When Louisa overhears this, she
correctly guesses he sold it to Dancer Blaine, who she ran into while
she was undercover. Marcus asks Louisa to tell Shirley Blaine doesn't
sell to drug gangs. He doesn't, she confirms, he sells to organized
crime.&nbsp;</span></span></span></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">That
conversation is cut short when Louisa gets a call from River's
mother, who Louisa had previously reached out to when she thought
River was dead. She explains what happened to David and River, but
River's mother isn't all that interested. She hasn't spoken to David
in years and she just wants Louisa to remind River she exists.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Back
at Slough House, Roddy (Christopher Chung) has figured out why Moira
was sent there. When she was working the duty logs she noted someone
with the code name &quot;Galahad&quot; picked up a prostitute. Turns
out Galahad is Claude Whelan (James Callis).</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once
they get back to the office, Louisa tries to figure out how they can
support River and Lamb. JK (Tom Brooke) says they can't, citing the
Slow Horses are all checked out, something he apparently can ID
because he was previously in a psych evaluation. Shirley scoffs at
this, but JK then breaks her down with pinpoint accuracy, which
shakes her a bit. Louisa gets them back on track by figuring out what
could have happened to Patrice after he attacked Chapman? He was
injured, so they figure he could have gone to a back alley doctor.
Moira says there's a database of those for undercover agents.</font></font></p>

<span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#333333"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Whelan
shows Taverner what Giti (Kiran Sonia Sawar) found out about Adam
Lockhead. He was in Munich when a car bomb went off, in Paris when a
Palestinian human rights activist was poisoned and Stockholm for
another killing; so was Robert Winters. Taverner pieces together that
MI5's cold bodies are being used by a &quot;death squad.&quot; With
this revelation, Whelan has come around to Taverner's way of
thinking: they need to bury this. Taverner agrees. When Whelan brings
up the Cartwrights, she says they'll buy their silence by promising
to keep whoever killed the imposter out of jail.</span></span></span></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Still
on their way to the Park, River guesses Emma didn't mention the photo
earlier because she thinks Taverner will destroy it. Emma admits she
left her old job because of corruption, but MI5 is turning out to be
the same — people doing whatever they need to regardless of
consequences. River clarifies all he's trying to do is protect his
grandfather, but since he's in handcuffs, that responsibility falls
on Emma. He asks her to send the photo to someone she can trust (in
this case Giti), find out who everyone in the picture is and take it
to Whelan (who Emma copies on message).</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Elsewhere,
Lamb takes David to an old church. He explains to Standish that David
created the cold body that blew up Westactres, but he needs to figure
out who he gave it to and why. Standish is worried Lamb is going to
hurt David, but instead, he leads him to David's wife's grave, with
Lamb goading David to tell her he killed River. Lamb continues to
badger David with this lie until David admits he &quot;did it for
her.&quot; The girl he extracted from France was David's daughter, as
he wanted to get her away from Frank, who organized preemptive
assassinations with his group of children, &quot;killers raised from
birth.&quot; David never told anyone what he did. Standish wonders if
that's the case, why does Frank want him dead? Lamb figures it's
because he can connect Frank to Westacres. Standish says they should
take David to the Park, but Lamb knows they don't want to be
connected to Westacres either, so they'll take him back to Slough
House.</font></font></p>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Frank,
having gotten the access codes from Molly without torture, is
tracking River. Patrice shows up. He didn't get David's location from
Chapman, but he has Chapman's phone in case David calls. Using
Molly's computer, Frank pulls up pictures of Lamb and the Slow
Horses, who Patrice confirms are the people who stopped him from
getting Chapman. When Frank points out they're &quot;burnouts,&quot;
Patrice says he deserves to be punished. Frank doesn't want to hear
that, instead, Patrice needs to channel his emotions to the next
step. In this case, it's Patrice beating up trash collectors,
stealing their truck and driving off. Frank, meanwhile, leaves
Molly's, but also leaves behind a handful of closed envelopes with
names on them, including Claude Whelan.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">At
the Park, Giti tells Taverner and Whelan she completed the task Emma
sent her. This catches them off guard as Whelan didn't check his
phone. Giti continues she was able to ID Patrice, who used another
cold body, Paul Wayne, and Frank, then lists off their litany of
terrible crimes. Taverner sends Giti off to get descriptions of
Patrice and Frank to agents. Whelan asks &quot;we don't have a
concrete box big enough for this, do we?&quot; Taverner says no.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Having
cracked into the database, Roddy found that one doctor on the list
died that day, then spots Patrice on CCTV footage at the doctor's
location. He also finds out that the Dogs have River. Louisa calls
Lamb with these updates and says Chapman is likely still in danger
(they don't know Patrice already got to him). Lamb has Standish take
David back to Slough House while he'll go check on Chapman.</font></font></p>

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Emma
and River are starting to get along, particularly when they start
talking about Lamb. But their chit-chat is cut short when Patrice
crashes into their car with the garbage truck. They try to turn
around but the car is blocked in.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="Lato Semibold"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">One
of the Dogs tries to get out but Patrice quickly shoots him, then
kills the other Dog. Emma starts to fight Patrice, but is knocked
out. Patrice pulls the gun on River, but instead of killing him,
shoots his handcuffs off. He then kidnaps River at gunpoint, steals a
car and puts River in the trunk (aka a boot in the UK). But where is
Patrice taking him?</font></font></p>
