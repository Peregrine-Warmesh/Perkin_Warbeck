out it's just Roddy (Christopher Chung), hanging out in a fast-food
chicken restaurant by himself. He finally manages to get hold of
Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar) and asks her why no one has shown up for
their Christmas party? They don't have a Christmas party, she tells
him. It takes Roddy a minute, but he finally figures Lamb was playing

explosion was caused by a car bomb at the Westacres shopping center.
Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) arrives on the scene, but she's not
alone. She is joined by the new First Desk, Claude Whelan (James
Callis). Whelan is nearly in shock from the scene, while Taverner is
all business, asking for everything they know.<br/>
The bomber was a
28-year-old IT consultant named Robert Winters with no clear
background as to why he'd do this. With the address he gave the car
rental company being a fake, Taverner believes Winters is an alias as
well. Whelan asks if it could be a one-off? Either that or the start
of something, Taverner says.</span></span></span></font></span></font></font></p>

and Louisa have that same conversation the next day at a pub until
River needs to get something off his chest. He stumbles about how
close he's felt with Louisa, making her nervous he is going to ask
her out. She nixes that before he gets too far, but to her
embarrassment that's not what River is talking about. He reveals his
grandfather, David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce), is losing his mental
facilities. The last time River saw him it took David 10 minutes to
remember River. What should he do? She tells him the only thing he
can do is to take care of him, starting with going to see him that

won't take any chances though. He grabs a shotgun, closes the blinds

as he enters.</span></span></span></font></span></font></font></p>

Lamb the scene, Emma explains David pushed his panic button at 9:03
pm, but the police didn't arrive until 9:49 (they apparently have
been called needlessly by David before because of his forgetfulness).
Despite finding River's phone and wallet at the scene, Emma wants
Lamb to ID River's body, which is tricky because in addition to the
chest wound he was also shot in the face. Lamb makes a few jokes,
which raises Emma's suspicion about why he doesn't seem concerned.
But he assures her he's lost agents before and he's certainly not
River's biggest fan. Ultimately, he identifies the body as River.</font></font></p>

are a number of new members at the Park and Slough House we meet in
this episode. We already discussed Flyte and Whelan, but while the
former seems quite competent (though we learn she was an outside hire
suggested by Whelan), we might want to be worried about the new First
Desk. He does not seem to know what he is doing, asking Taverner to
give him an idea of what to expect in a big meeting and then just
asking her to handle it and report back to him.</font></font></p>

at Slough House, we meet Moira Tregorian (Joanna Scanlan), who is
Standish's replacement as office manager, as she walks in on Marcus

anyone or anything and hand the scene over to forensics. However,
someone opens up the window blinds, which pulls the pins on a number
of grenades, causing a big explosion and killing multiple people.
Taverner not only has to deal with this mess, but council an
ashen-faced Whelan on his duties (notifying the families).</font></font></p>

tries to coax her to admit she knows River is still alive. She denies
it, but bluffing was never her strong suit; River’s car is outside.
Standish finally admits River was there, but he isn't now. Lamb isn't

<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">David
explains he thought it was River initially, but when he called him
&quot;gramps&quot; he got suspicious. When the imposter lunged at
him, David shot him. It's a good thing he did, because River finds
drugs on the body, figuring they were going to knock David out and
kill him. River also finds a return train ticket to France, a receipt
from a cafe called Le Blanc Russe in Lavande and a passport with the
name Adam Lockhead.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">All
of this flusters David, so he hits his panic button, which puts them
on the clock. If David talks to the police, River worries he'll be
taken away. David has an outburst, yelling at River not to speak to
him that way because he's his father. That slip-up convinces David
that River is right. River says they need to get somewhere safe, but
first, he leaves behind his phone and wallet to make it look like
it's really him, then shoots the imposter in the face to obscure the
body (promptly puking after seeing the result).</font></font></p>
<p><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#333333"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">At
the Park, Giti Rahman (Kiran Sonia Sawar) reports to Taverner
(Kristin Scott Thomas) that Robert Winters' passport appears to have
been issued by the agency 28 years ago; was Winters one of their
agents? After confirming this was brought straight to her, Taverner
arranges for Flyte (Ruth Bradley) to take Giti to a safe location so
they can dig up everything they need to on Winters (in reality
isolate her).<br/>
</span></span></span></font></span>Lamb (Gary
Oldman) is also trying to comb through the past. Once Standish
(Saskia Reeves) confirms River is headed to France, the Slough House
head tries to get some answers out of David. But David is confused,
and despite Lamb thinking it's all an act, he isn't able to get a
clear answer out of him. He'll have to find out what the connection
is between David and France on his own.</font></font></p>

Taverner, she patiently sits as Whelan (James Callis) talks about how
the Park needs to be more transparent and install a culture change.
Taverner dances around whether or not she agrees with him, noting
they are at a heightened threat level at the moment. She does have
some housekeeping for him though, having him sign condolence letters
for the agents who died in the apartment bombing.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Later,
Taverner checks in on Giti, telling her there must have been a
glitch: the Park created a fake ID for Robert Winter, not Robert
Winters, 30 years ago, telling her the bomber has nothing to do with
the Park. However, as she tells Giti this, she is destroying all
evidence related to the ID in the archive.</font></font></p>

Taverner
then has another meeting with Whelan, this time on a bus, away from
the eyes and ears of the Park. She tells him Robert Winters was
actually the Park's fake ID (or cold body, as she puts it), but she's
deleted all records of him. Whelan is upset she didn't tell him
sooner so he could take it to the Prime Minister and begin an
inquiry. That's exactly why she didn't tell him.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">When
Whelan insists they divulge this, Taverner pulls out a trump card:
Whelan authorized the sequestering of Giti (the documents she said
were condolence letters). Whelan didn't read the document, but he's
now complicit in the act. Whelan thinks Taverner is doing this out of
revenge for him getting First Desk. She rebuts she didn't apply for
the job, yet she is still doing the key bits, pointing out the job
isn't &quot;big picture,&quot; as he puts it, it's putting out fires
every day.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">At
Slough House, Lamb chastises Roddy (Christopher Chung) for stealing
River's computer, telling him River isn't dead. The whole team is
confused. Only JK (Tom Brooke), saying something for the first time,
realizes Lamb never said River was dead. As to why he strung them
along, and devastated Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar), Lamb says River is a
Joe in the field, and you never blow a Joe's cover (he particularly
emphasizes this for JK). Louisa asks how they can help River?
Nothing, Lamb says, just let him retrace the assassin's steps in
France. &quot;France is big,&quot; Marcus (Kadiff Kirwan) astutely
points out.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">But
Lamb and Taverner aren't the only spies doing their job. A delivery
guy (Tom Woznickza) with a French accent arrives at the Cartwright
house. He asks the police what happened? They let slip a young man
died. As he leaves, the Frenchman discreetly places a camera in the
stonewall. Once in the car he calls someone, a bearded man whose face
we don't see, and tells him David is still alive and either River or
Bertrand (the imposter) was killed instead. The bearded man knows
that Betrand's passport was used to get into the country, so he'll
wait to see who shows up, but the Frenchman should get to his next
target: an old employee of David's (Lamb?).</font></font></p>

few Slough House things to note in this episode. Shirley spots Marcus
has a gun in his bag, somehow inferring this means he's gambling
again. Marcus eventually admits he's planning to sell the gun on the
street to get money for a bet on a sure thing, then pay his debts and
buy the gun back before anyone can do something bad with it. Noting
the desperate nature of this, Shirley says Marcus should have come to
her as a friend. Though, can she give him £10,000 to keep him from
losing his house and wife?</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Elsewhere,
Lamb finally meets Moira (Joanna Scanlan), who has cleaned Lamb's
office (much to his dismay). He takes her to lunch where he pokes a
hole in her sunny disposition about being at Slough House by
reminding her only two types of people end up there: screw-ups and
those that have pissed someone off. He doesn't think she is a
screw-up, so he offers her a deal: use her connections still at the
Park to get info on when and why David was ever in France during his
career and he'll get her back to the Park. She agrees.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">River
arrives at Les Arbres, an abandoned-looking estate with weaponry and
bullet casings lying about in the yard. When River feels the kettle
is still warm in the house, he realizes he is not alone. He searches
the house, taking a special note of a mural of a valley and animals
before eventually finding a picture of a group of men, one of which
is Robert Winters.</font></font></p>

then realizes a fire has started downstairs. As he tries to make his
way out he is hit in the back of the head by the bearded man (played
by Hugo Weaving). They fight, but the bearded man is scared off when
the Frenchmen that was tracking River comes in with a shotgun. He
grabs River, takes him out of the house and puts him in a van. River
tries to thank him, but is quickly knocked out with the butt of the
shotgun and driven off the property to who knows where.</font></font></p>

he isn't cuffed, River is locked in the room. He hears footsteps
coming up the stairs, so he grabs a pot to defend himself. But he's
immediately outmatched when the man who kidnapped him (Eric Savin)
bursts in with a shotgun. River doesn't fight, he just wants to know
what's going on. All the man tells him is that someone is coming to
talk to him.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><br/>
David
Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce) is still struggling to get a grip on
what's going on. At Standish's (Saskia Reeves), he talks about River
and the bomber before insisting he speak with First Desk to warn them
about what's coming. Standish calms him by saying First Desk is busy
reading wires from Berlin, as if it's still the Cold War, but
promising to set up an appointment. This works, but David still
rambles on, saying it's all his fault.</font></font></p>

at Slough House, Lamb (Gary Oldman) immediately notices a footprint
in the entryway, quickly figuring out it belongs to Emma Flyte (Ruth
Bradley). Knowing it can't be good, he tells Louisa (Rosalind
Eleazar) to go to Standish's and get her to move David.</font></font></span></p>

with Emma in his office, Lamb correctly guesses they finally pieced
together the dead body isn't River. He deflects blame saying River is
his agent, and since he clearly wanted to be thought of as dead, Lamb
was going to keep it that way as long as he could. Emma handcuffs
Lamb for obstructing the investigation and plans to take him to the
Park. Guessing he's a sacrificial lamb (no pun intended) to Taverner
after Emma screwed up the River situation, he offers an alternative:
telling her where David is. When Emma asks why he would do this, Lamb
says, &quot;Because going to the Park is like being in IKEA, you can
never get out of the f***ing place.&quot; Emma agrees.</font></font></p>

machine. Emma slowly approaches, gets inches away from his face
before handcuffing him to the machine, leaving him stuck and
embarrassed.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Louisa
is on her way to Standish's apartment but is unable to get a hold of
her (remember, River has her phone but also took the SIM card out).
As she arrives, she sees Emma has beaten her there. Louisa attempts
to remedy this by telling Emma she is being followed and wants her
help, but Emma just passes it off to one of her subordinates and
heads inside.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Emma
uses her authority to get into Standish's apartment and search for
David, but when she can't find him she quickly loses her cool.
Standish asks who told her David was at her apartment, and as soon as
Emma says Jackson Lamb she realizes he must have played her.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">After
Emma leaves, Louisa meets up with Standish. She assumed if Lamb could
figure out where David was so easily, someone at the Park was likely
to do the same, so she put him in a friend's apartment. However, when
they go to get David, they see the back door is open and David is
nowhere to be found. He's out somewhere in the streets of London.</font></font></p>

getting sideswiped by Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas) on the Robert
Winter cold body situation, Whelan (James Callis) attempts to regain
some of his power as First Desk. He recruits Giti (Kiran Sonia Sawar)
to check archives for any additional cold body &quot;glitches,&quot;
asking her to report directly to him; no need to worry Taverner.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Down
in archives. Whelan tells head archivist Molly (Naomi Wirthner) what
Giti is going to be doing. Molly is tired of being in the middle of
these games between First and Second Desk. Claude tries to assert his
rank, asking who she thinks is the one with the real power. But she
quickly rebukes him by saying Taverner does.</font></font></p>

(Kadiff Kirwan) is heading out to sell his gun so he can pay his
gambling debts, despite Shirley's (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) protests.
Shirley then gets a call from Roddy asking for help. She isn't
interested until he reveals he is handcuffed to his weight machine.
JK (Tom Brooke), who is starting to talk more but is still acting
weird, joins her.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">JK
quickly opts to help Roddy out, much to Shirley's chagrin, who pulls
his hood back. JK pulls a knife and holds it to her throat, telling
her he was previously handcuffed to a chair for 72 hours and
tortured, so seeing Roddy this way is triggering for him. Once free,
Roddy tries to fist-bump JK for the help, but JK doesn't like to be
touched (clearly).</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Meanwhile,
Marcus meets with an illegal arms dealer named Dancer Blaine
(Turlough Convery). He's leery of Marcus, but recognizes he must be
in a jam, so he offers £3,000 for the gun; despite his attempts to
negotiate, Dancer holds firm and Marcus relents to his price.</font></font></p>

As
River watches more people gather outside the building, a woman
(Coralie Audret) enters the house. She and River's kidnapper come
back in, wanting to know who River is and why he has Bertrand's
passport? River explains Bertrand came to his grandfather's house
with the intent to kill him, but David shot him instead.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">It
turns out the woman is Natasha, Bertrand's mother, while the man is
Victor, Bertrand's uncle. They tell River to leave, but with the
growing mob outside seemingly waiting for him (they think he is
Bertrand), River reveals he is MI5 and shows the picture he found at
the chateau. He wants to know about the man Bertrand is with in the
picture, saying he is responsible for the Westacre bombing and he
needs to find him before another bomb goes off.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Natasha
explains the older man is Frank Harkness (Hugo Weaving). He had sons
with multiple women from different countries. River asks if Natasha
painted the mural he found, but she says no, one of the other women
did. As they talk, even more people gather outside with the mob.
Natasha explains the leader of the mob's daughter was assaulted and
put in the hospital by Bertrand. Victor tries to go explain the
situation so River can leave, but he is quickly knocked out and the
mob attempts to break into the house.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">River
races through the house and is able to escape through the bathroom
window. However, the mob won't stop that easily, continuing to chase
him through the streets. River eventually is able to steal a moped
off a local, which allows him to get away.</font></font></p>

(Joanna Scanlan) tells Lamb her contacts at the Park weren't able to
find any evidence David was ever in France. However, his bagman, Sam
Chapman (Sean Gilder) was in the early 90s. This is enough for Lamb,
telling Moira he'll follow up on his end and try and get her out of
Slough House.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Lamb
calls Chapman and tells him they need to meet. However, the Frenchman
(Tom Wozniczka) is watching Chapman and is given orders by Frank to
follow and kill him. Chapman soon realizes he is being tailed and
calls Lamb to abort the mission, but Lamb tells him to keep moving
and he'll get his Slow Horses to help out.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Shirley
and Marcus, back from his gun deal, are on it. They think they have
eyes on the Frenchman but lose him, until he comes running up and
shoves Marcus into a store window. Shirley picks up a shard of glass
and goes after the Frenchman.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Chapman
makes it to the rendezvous, an old garage, takes out his baton, grabs
a wrench and hides. The Frenchman searches the place, gun drawn, when
Shirley rushes in and stabs him with the glass shard. He knocks her
out and is about to pull the trigger on her when Chapman comes out
and fights the Frenchman. Marcus then joins in. Lamb walks by the
garage and sees the fight but just keeps walking. The Frenchman
eventually gains the upper hand against them and is poised to kill
Chapman, but that's when Lamb bursts in, driving a taxi and running
over the Frenchman.</font></font></p>
<p style="border: none; padding: 0cm"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">He
checks on Chapman and his team before going to grab the Frenchman,
