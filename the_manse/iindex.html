From early days Perkin Warbeck was interested in sport. There was little precedent for this in his parents, although his Uncle John had been some sort of Dundee tennis champ and Warbeck was given the former's Dunlop Maxply Wooden racket. <BR>
Naturally, one of the first sports to which our hero was attracted was football. This was done in the Orchar park, Broughty Ferry. He was adequate without really flourishing. he played in a couple of five a side teams, but in about third year at secondary he transferred to hockey and had a decent career there.<BR>
His brother Kenny, on the other hand - was excellent and was once watched by Jim McLean.<BR>

As an aside, my pal Phil Blakeman once wrote a
<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline" href="TAC75.pdf" >very funny piece</a> for the Angry Corrie magazine (of which, more later) that referenced Kenny and football at the Orchar Park. </center><BR>

<B><center>Personal interests: WATCHING FOOTBALL</center><BR></B>
A family came to live next door called the Inglis. Marilyn was ages with my older brother and Dougie was ages with Kenny.<BR> Dougie was a Dundee United supporter and in games in the lane outside our back doors began to school us in their players. Doug Smith, Finn Dossing, Lennart Wing etc<BR>
Our own dad didn't take us to the football because he thought people would be sick on us or swear or something, but Dougie Inglis' dad was allowed to take us. My first game was a reserve game where Hamish McAlpine was in goal and Wattie Smith was in defence. <BR>
Back in those days Dundee FC was the hegemonic team. I was in a class of 45 (I KNOW) - I was the only United supporter. Dundee had won the Scottish league and reached the semi final of the European Cup. I supported them in that - of course. As Michael Marra has said "we're not Glaswegian about it"
