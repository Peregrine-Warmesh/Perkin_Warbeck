    <center>      "But why are you called Perkin Warbeck?"<BR>
I have had to answer this so often in my life<BR>
There was a stage in my life when I was in a "band" with my good friend Phil Blakeman.<BR>
It was in the era of punk and many people were adopting sobriquets<BR>
I told Phil about some girls who had a band called Stacey and the Hypocrites (great name)<BR>
"I am going to be Phil Stacey" he declaimed.<BR>
"Who are you going to be?" <BR>
All my life I have loved the Just William books by Richmal Crompton. I was shocked to discover that the author was a woman because she understood boys so well. William has an old scholl education - latin, gography, histry (his spellings). With his knowledge of "histry" he became interested in the character of Perkin Warbeck - because the latter was a "rebbl" and so was William.
"I shall be Perkin Warbeck"<BR>
And here we are 40 odd years later.<BR>
One of the prime passages for me is copied below<BR>
A wee while ago a rabbi calculated that there were approximately 365 William stories and created a 365 page effort called "Just William's Year"<BR>

…”I can’t help you bein’ so ign’rant that you don’t know that ‘corpse’ means ‘wood’ in plays an’ po’try” said William crushingly. “If I’ve got to write plays for people that don’t know any English, I might as well stop writin’ them altogether.”<BR>
