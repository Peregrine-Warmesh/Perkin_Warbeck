         On 31 Janauary 2002 Bruce Cockburn my long term hero played the Old Fruitmarket Glasgow. I have seen him many times, about seven in all, but a visit to your home town is always exciting.
The man was fantastic. How he makes that one guitar make all that heavenly sound is beyond me. According to a recent Canadian TV program it is also beyond Jackson Browne. Ricky had pulled a few strings and we ended up backstage. I will never be too cool to ask for a photo and here it is.
A Cockburn gig always seems to have a request for the most obscure song out of the back catalogue and this was no exception. Someone shouted "why don't we celebrate" "Aren't we?" responded Bruce. I was the wag who shouted for "Nanzen Ji"
