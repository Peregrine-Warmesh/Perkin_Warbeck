<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5">Monktacus has undertaken a quest to find
Monkey's family. All that Monktacus knew at the start of the quest was
that monkey had an idyllic childhood on the banks of the Ganges near a
temple.</font>

<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5">There are many temples in India and many
on the banks of the Ganges. Monktacus knew where monkey joined the circus,
so his home had to be upstream from there. Monktacus has purchased a boat
and is proceeding up river like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now.
<p>The first temple he visited was the Golden
Temple at Amritsar. The monks there were so taken with Monktacus that they
asked him to join them. He refused, being essentially warlike and not suited
to the mystical path. In fact he is not all that sure about Monkey's frequent
visits to the Astral Plane.</font>

<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5">Monktacus was stunned by the beauty of it
all, but he was hardly getting any nearer finding Monkey's family. He realised
that he would need an interpreter who spoke both Latin and Punjabi. This
would be a tricky task, but apparently some of the Saddhus as the Holy
Men were called , could go into a trance and speak all the tongues of the
world.</font>

realised that he was in for an epic journey. But he couldn't understand
why a troop of hungry monkeys would remove themselves from a certain source
of food namely the constant stream of pilgrims that attends a Ganges temple,
and take themselves to the arid high terrain of the Himalaya.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5">Monktacus squinted again at the panorama
on the horizon. The shapes of the peaks rung a distant bell. Grabbing his
copy of "a soldier's almanac of the known world, he thumbed quickly to
the chapter entitled "skylines and landscapes". Thsi chapter was designed
so that a soldier, transported to anywhere in the world could quickly orientate
himself by referring to its pages. Monktacus had made good use of it recently
when in Afghanistan, identifying the silhouettes of the Hindu Kush. "Nanda
Devi" he muttered. Monktacus had been endlessly badgered by Monkey on the
subject of the beauty of the Indian Himalayas and the Nanda Devi Sanctuary
in particular. Oft-times when on manoeuvres, Monkey had entertained Montacus
doing "mountain charades". Monktacus, likewise could do the Alps due to
his crossing with Hannibal, and the seven hills of Rome.</font>
<br><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5"">Monktacus had not survived the intrigue
and internecine skullduggery of the Roman Senate without developing a brain
like a rat trap. Nanda Devi is part of the same group as Hanuman, the peak
of the Monkey God and Changabang, a peak whose name in fact resembles more
than coincidence ought to allow, the name of THE Monkey Go~~d. There was
nothing Monktacus could put his finger on, but there seemed too much co-incidence.
"We must set off for the Garhwal Himalaya", he told the holy man chucking
him a roman coin.</font>
<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5"">In case the reader is interested, here are
the shapes that Monktacus recognised</font>

<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5""><H2>15 days later</H2></font>
<br><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5"">Monktacus breathed heavily. In the thin
air of the high Himalaya, no effort came easily. He had crossed the Alps
with Hannibal, but no one reared in Rome has the physiology for the rarified
air at 20,000 feet. He was aware, from occasional satellite phone calls
from Trumpet, that Monkey was distraught back in Monkeytown. The twin barbs
of separation from Monktacus and separation from his natural family were
almost too much to bear. But Monktacus task had become awesome. It appeared
from various conversations along the banks of the ganges, that Monkey's
original family had set off for the Nanda Devi sanctuary, believing that
there were people there for whom monkeys were the highest form of life
and that among these people they could live an idyllic existence.</font>
<br><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5"">Monktacus had wasted no time in hiring a
team of Sherpas and some yaks. He was used to ordering men, but the Sherpas
were a proud race and drove a hard bargain. The Sirdar or head Sherpa was
a wiry and fantastically hardy man called Ang Temba.</font>

<p><font face="DejaVu Sans" size = "5"">Monktacus would not have set off on such
a quest without the highest degree of confidence. Within 5 miles of his
journey, they had passed some wall writings which confirmed in the strongest
possible terms, the truth of his information.</font>

the created order"</font></td>
