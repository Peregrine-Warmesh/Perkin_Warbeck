Abbot's
quarters.&nbsp;</b>
<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"Esteemed excellency" he began.
All his
years in Rome had taught him how to address important people. "I am
seeking a family of monkeys"...</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><img src="abbot.jpg" border="0" height="232" width="300"></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<b>Monktacus recounted the salient facts of monkey's
family to the abbot.</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"Ah yes said the abbot. I know
them well.
They were distraught at the loss of the young monkey and determined to
find him.
rather than go down the ganges and seek him in the physical world they
sought to
find him via the Astral Plane"</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"How enterprising" thought </b>
<b>Monktacus. "But how would one do that?"</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"They asked me for a list of
holy
mountains, where they might access the Astral Plane"</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"I warned them it would be
cold, but they
were determined"</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"Give me the list" said
Monktacus</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>The Abbot handed over an old
parchment</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"The Holy Mountains of the
Himalaya"
was the title.</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"Trango Towers", read Monktacus</b></p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">This is too difficult" said&nbsp;
Monktacus
scratching his noble Roman brow. "The Himalaya are full of Holy
Mountains.
We need a way to narrow it down; to guess how monkey's family would
choose. Wait
a minute........</span></font></b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>Monkey shares their genetic
heritage.
maybe we
should give him the list and see which he would choose"</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b> Monktacus whipped out his
satellite
phone and
dialled Monkey's number......</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>Monkey was spending some time
with one
of
Trumpet's aides researching "The Trumpet Years part II" . You can see
the Trumpet logo on his shirt</b></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>"It's
for you monkey" said the aide "looks like long distance"</b></p>

<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>"Monkey speaking
, state your
business". Monkey wanted to appear business like in front of the aide.</b></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>"Monktacus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</b></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>He bawled, all
professionalism
gone. </b></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>"Where are you?"</b></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>"I am sending an
e-picture", said
Montacus "can you see it ?"</b></font></p>

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><b>Monkey could indeed see it. "It
looks
fantastic
Montacus"</b></p>

to one of

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>Monkey composed
himself. It usually
annoyed

<p style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><font size="3"><b>"Om Mane Padme
OM" chanted Monkey
in
preparation and was off into a trance.</b></font></p>
