<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus made his way to the Abbot's
quarters.&nbsp;</font></b>
<p>

years in Rome had taught him how to address important people. &quot;I am
seeking a family of monkeys&quot;...</font></b></p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus recounted the salient facts of monkey's
family to the abbot.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Ah yes said the abbot. I know them well.
They were distraught at the loss of the young monkey and determined to find him.
rather than go down the ganges and seek him in the physical world they sought to
find him via the Astral Plane&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;How enterprising&quot; thought </font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus. &quot;But how would one do that?&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;They asked me for a list of holy
mountains, where they might access the Astral Plane&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;I warned them it would be cold, but they
were determined&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Give me the list&quot; said Monktacus</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Abbot handed over an old parchment</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;This is too difficult&quot; said&nbsp; Monktacus
scratching his noble Roman brow. &quot;The Himalaya are full of Holy Mountains.
We need a way to narrow it down; to guess how monkey's family would choose. Wait
a minute........</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monkey shares their genetic heritage. maybe we
should give him the list and see which he would choose&quot;</font></b></p>

dialled Monkey's number......</font></b></p>
