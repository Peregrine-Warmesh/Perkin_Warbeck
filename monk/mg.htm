<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This character may be a hallucination
or he may take the series into magical realism territory along the lines
of MacBeal. Production values will dictate which. If filming can be achieved
on the Storr with good weather, he may be treated as magical realism. His
size is to remain indeterminate, so he will never be seen in frame with
Monkey. Luminescence will surround his head and he will have tusks. There
are actually two monkey gods, Banga Chang and Ringa Chinga Nan. Very similar
in appearance except only the former has tusks.</font></b></td>
