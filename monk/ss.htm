statements. Many of these can be written off at face value. One he has
never recanted, however has been the claim to have climbed Mount Everest
without oxygen and not only that, with Trumpet and Circus Dog on his back.
This claim was so outlandish as to merit no investigation. Recently, however,

had been gathering dust in his Dolomite study. Make of it what you will.</font></font></td>
