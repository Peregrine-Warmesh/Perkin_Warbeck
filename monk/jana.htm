<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Elegant attractive female
monkey. Not on screen much. Encountered mainly through prolonged phone
calls from GM.(often on the mobie) However despite this , she is in fact
the progenitor of the whole monkey concept and this should be conveyed
by occasional flashbacks to her screeching "Nachanoo". Ambiguous relationship
with GM. Sometimes appear like sisters sometimes like mother/daughter.
Very naughty monkey. Appears to live with someone called "Molly" to whom
she is very michievous.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
