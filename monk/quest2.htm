<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus looked down at his feet.

His Roman sandals were in tatters. And he still had many miles to go till

he was near the last sighting of the troop of monkeys. There is no motorised

transport in the high Himalaya and he had been walking the yak trail now

for fourteen days. "there's got to be a better way " he mused. At times

he wished that he had taken Trumpet on the Quest and could have just sat

on his back. But this was foolish. Trumpet was too noble to be treated

just as a beast of burden. Anyway Tony Blair would no longer spare him

for something apparently so frivolous.</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncannily, just as he was thinking this,

he rounded a turn in the trail and saw the most wondrous sight.</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Leo Dickinson the famous adventurer who

had ballooned over Everest had left one of his balloons permanently in

the village of Namche. The locals were giving it one of its occasional

outings. Monktacus scrabbled in his pocket for some Roman coins. In a thrice

he had done a deal with the headman of he village. A loan of the balloon

for some Roman coins amounting to 5 years wages for the locals. Monktacus

had no experience of ballooning, but the Saddhu who was translating for

him claimed it was exactly like voyaging the Astral Plane and that he would

take charge.</font></b>

<p><img SRC="yaks.jpg" height=144 width=440>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus paid off the yak drivers and

bad them farewell. This was a tender moment for he had bonded quite strongly

with the yaks. it reminded him a wee bit of crossing the Alps on the elephants

with Hannibal.</font></b>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus bought some supplies from&nbsp;

the locals. A new pair of shoes, some rice, some tumba, (the Tibetan alcohol)

to keep the Saddhu high.</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus threw out the ballast (he knew

that much about ballooning) and waited for the balloon to rise. Nothing

happened. He turned round and saw the reason. The Saddhu was expecting

to bring with him a full size stone representation of Ganeesha!</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus pondered. The Saddhu had been

worth his weight in Roman coinage up till now. His bi-linuistic skills

had paved the way to where they were. But Monktacus was used to well ordered

obedience from his subordinates. The Saddhu was motivated by all sorts

of mystic thoughts and urges, mostly culled at random from the Bhagavad-Gita

or the Astral Plane.</font></b></td>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus gave the Saddhu a lecture on the

physics of hot air ballooning. Monktacus had after all discussed the laws

of motion with Ptolemy in his day. Monktacus dozed off. He had not slept

in ten days and hoped that the Saddhu could be trusted to fly the balloon

for a while. Hardly had he dozed, though than he was awoken by the balloon

madly pitching and assailed by an ear splitting roar. Monktacus imagined

the worst. The Saddhu had probably communed with Khali. Imagine his surprise

however on seeing this.</font></b>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He could hardly believe his eyes.&nbsp;

Just when a hot air balloon had seemed like the epitome of efficiency,

he was being taunted by a 'plane. The turbulence from the plane rocked

the balloon. A man lesser than Monktacus would undoubtedly have panicked.

And as for Monkey Slave, who knows how that timorous creature would have

reacted. Monktacus however calmly adjusted the gas flow to the burner and

told the Saddhu they would try and follow the plane as it must lead to

an airstrip and it appeared to be descending.</font></b></td>

The plane suddenly produced from nacelles under its fuselage a pair of

floats and landed on Lake Gokyo. Monktacus wondered what sort of expedition

it could be. He did not have long to wait. Out from the plane stepped Lussia's

men and the wee fat dyed-blonde haired kilty man from the Coach House Coffee

Shop.&nbsp;</font></b></td>

of whom he had some experience had heard that locally to lake Gokyo, there

were remarkably "fresh and vibrant " wall hangings made. Through Monktacus'

high powered binoculars, he could just make out the hanging that was about

to be purchased. It was in the Buddhist tradition, but Monktacus knew that

with its remarkable resemblance to the Monkey Go~~d, that the days of Monkey

patronising the Coach House were over.</font></b></td>

sat listlessly toying with the satellite phone.&nbsp;</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Come on Monkey" said Monkey Girlfriend

"life has to go on; you've got a public in the Jungle, and all those patients

at your work. Why -&nbsp; do you realise that while you've not been at

the decks, the Monkeytown club scene has embraced "Afro-Teuchter-Garage_Ceilidh?

Yes we have no bananas hasn't resounded round the Jungle in weeks". In

times past this would have been a dart to the heart of Monkey. But with

the twin burden of lack of Monktacus and doubt about his birth family,

the evolution of the Monkeytown Club Scene didn't seem quite so important

somehow.</font></b></td>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"Can't you just enjoy the story Monkey" said

Monkey Girlfriend. "Wasn't that funny with the Saddhu and Ganeesha?"</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">"That just made me miss Trumpet all the

more" replied Monkey.</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monkey Girlfriend could see that there

was no dealing with it. Monkey badly needed some sort of hard evidence

pertaining to his birth family.</font></b>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">At this moment, Monktacus was flying

over Ama Dablam. He considered it pretty close to the most beautiful mountain

he had ever seen. As they flew over the Shipton Col, the Saddhu started

to get agitated. He had been in a trance and was still hardly lucid, but

he was trying to tell Monktacus something. Once Monktacus had him calmed

down enough to talk some Latin, it transpired that the Saddhu thought he

had heard some monkey language drifting through the Aether. Since these

type of communication have a line of sight limitation, there might be some

monkeys nearby. Monktacus scanned the ground with his high powered binoculars.

Away to the North, he thought he saw a glint of light. Fortunately the

jet-stream was taking them that way.</font></b></td>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">As they passed over the source of the

glint, Monktacus' trained military eye detected a building. There was no

time to lose and he hauled on the lanyard that spilled hot air from the

balloon. Down they plunged at such a rate that even the perpetually myticised

Saddhu became quite alert.</font></b></td>

ballooning but like most military men, he was adapting on the job. It helps

to have an eye that is used to judging the flight of a spear or arrow or

the interception course of two war chariots. As&nbsp; the details of the

temple became clear the Saddhu got more and more excited. It was clear

that this temple was of very special significance. The Saddhu was rambling

away in a mixture of Latin, Nepalese and a curious language that is only

used on t he Astral Plane.</font></b></td>

<td><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;In the middle of the complex, Monktacus

spied a circular structure "a stupa" he muttered. The Saddhu looked happy.

Stupas are the beautiful domed structures seen in many Buddhist Temples.

On each of the four sides of the main stupa there are a pair of big eyes.

These eyes are symbolic of God's all-seeing perspective. There is no nose

between the eyes but rather a representation of the number one in the Nepali

alphabet, signifying that the single way to enlightenment is through the

Buddhist path.&nbsp;</font></b></td>

the third eye, signifying the wisdom of looking within. No ears are shown

because it is said the Buddha is not interested in hearing prayers in praise

of him.&nbsp;</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But for the moment, fascinating though

it may be, the religious significance gave to one more terrestrial. The

look in the eyes was very very familiar to Monktacus. It was cheeky, it

was mischeivous, IT WAS MONKEY! Or at least it contained the very essence

of Monkey's cheeky smile.</font></b></td>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monktacus had arrived, by the most mystical

and unpredictable route at Swayambhunath:The Monkey Temple.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He had to pause for breath. Swayambhunath

is the stuff of monkey folklore. Every child monkey is told of this golden

temple where the monkey takes pride of place. Monktacus himself had often

wondered about retiring there when soldiering days were done, but he hadn't

even been sure till now that it existed.</font></b>

Monktacus bestrode the Forum in Rome and had fought at least once in the

Coloseum. But never had he seen such a beautiful building. And the architecture

was only the start. The magnificent thing about Swayambhunath was just

the amount of monkeys roaming about. They were everywhere.&nbsp;</font></b></td>
