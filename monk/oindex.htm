<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Sadly Monkey had no idea
how to get back home and so has become an orphan. Latterly his lack of
contact with his family has caused him such distress that Monktacus has
gone of f on a <a href="quest.htm">quest</a> to find them. Monkey and Trumpet
joined circus together. Learned many tricks in circus, but unfortunately
on bankruptcy, kindly circus owner had to sell monkey to zoo. Using agility
and tricks learned in circus monkey escapes from zoo and makes way to monkeytown
(a thinly disguised Glasgow). Main job is as DJ in "The Jungle" a club.
Monkey sits behind a DJ counter from which he dispenses such music as "yes
we have no bananas" "apeman" "the lion sleeps tonight".</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The singular take on glasgow
which is monkeytown's central motif is that the trendy and cool clubbers
shun 180 bpm music clubs such as the Volcano to come and listen to monkey.
Some of them call him a genius. Behaviour borders on arrogance but saving
grace is hint that Monkey knows he is at it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Most of the time Monkey is
happy-go-lucky. Cheeky and irreverent to all bar Monktacus and Trumpet.
Although he is obviously very fond of Monkey girlfriend he taunts her mercilessly
about her imbecility, her "foetid smell" and regularly demands "who are
you?" even when it is not obvious that he has just been to the astral plane.
Similarly , although he is clearly fond of Monkey Slave, it is not uncommon
for Monkey to tease or boss him about.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Occasionally Monkey appears
brooding and preoccupied. The absence of Monktacus can cause this, especially
if military matters are being seen to without Monkey. "Monktacus" he will
plaintively cry. Lately he has been brooding over his lost family (see
the <a href="quest.htm">Quest</a>)</font></font>
