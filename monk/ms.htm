<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Slave to the person he calls "madam",
actually Girl Monkey. Monkey tends to use him as a slave as well. Monktacus
is always trying to encourage him to be free, but he is very happy with
his lot. "My life: to serve madam" is his watchword along with "I'll rest
when I'm dead". Very occasionally shows signs of melancholia. Recently
the Bruce Cockburn song "<a href="http://cockburnproject.net/songs&music/aaa.html">anything anytime
 anywhere</a>" has become a new anthem for Monkey Slave. His version
goes "anything anytime anywhere for madam"</font></b></td>
